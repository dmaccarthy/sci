<p><em class="Defn">Dalton’s Billiard Ball Model</em> proposes that atoms are featureless spheres.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Different elements have atoms of different sizes.</li>
    <li>This model explains the <em class="Defn">Law of Definite Proportions</em> and is the basis of <em class="Defn">Kinertic-Molecular Theory</em> (which explains phenomena such as temperature and the ideal gas law).</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Thomson’s CRT Experiment</em> studied how uniform electric and magnetic fields affected a beam of particles in a cathode ray tube.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The particles are accelerated into a beam by an <em>accelerating potential</em>:
        <p class="TeX">q\Delta V_{acc} = W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</p></li>
    <li>A <em>deflecting potential</em> creates an electric field that deflects the particles perpendicular to their direction of motion.</li>
    <li>A magnetic field creates a force in the opposite direction to the electric force.</li>
    <li>Then the field strengths are adjusted until the forces balance:
        <p class="TeX">q|\vec{\mathbf E}| = F_e = F_m = qvB</p></li>
    <li>This allows the speed of the particles to be calculated.</li>
    <li>Turning off the deflecting electric field results in uniform circular motion through the magnetic field:
        <p class="TeX">F_m = ma</p>
        <p class="TeX">qvB = m\frac{v^2}{r}</p>
        <p class="TeX">\frac{q}{m} = \frac{v}{Br}</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>When Thomson performed his CRT experiment on both negative and positive charges, his conclusions were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The negative particles (<em class="Defn">electrons</em>) have much smaller masses than the positive charges.</li>
    <li>Electrons are identical in all elements.</li>
    <li>The positive parts are <em>not</em> identical in different elements.</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Thomson’s Raisin Bun Model</em> proposes that atoms are like a positively-charged bun with electrons embedded in it like raisins.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atoms of different elements have different sizes, as in Dalton’s model.</li>
    <li>Larger elements have more electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden <em class="Defn">scattered alpha particles</em> (helium-4 nuclei produced by radioactive decay) from a thin foil of gold or aluminum.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most alpha particles passed through undeflected, as expected.</li>
    <li>A small fraction of the particles scattered to large angles, which could not be explained by the Raisin Bun model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rutherford proposed the <em class="Defn">Planetary (Nuclear) Model</em> to replace the Raisin Bun.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A small but massive nucleus contains the atom’s positive charge and almost all of its mass.</li>
    <li>Electrons orbit around the nucleus like planets around the Sun.</li>
    <li>Most of the alpha particles were undeflected because they encountered only empty space.</li>
    <li>Large deflections occur for the small fraction of alpha particles that collide head-on (or close to head-on) with the nucleus.</li>
    <li>Analysis of the results shows that the diameter of the nucleus is <span class="TeX">10^4</span> or <span class="TeX">10^5</span> times smaller than the diameter of the atom.</li>
    <li>Rutherford’s model does <em>not</em> explain why the orbiting (accelerating!) electrons do not continuously emit EMR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Niels Bohr modified the Planetary Model by adding the idea of <em class="Defn">energy levels</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assuming that the <em class="Defn">angular momentum</em> of the orbiting electrons was quantized, Bohr showed that electrons could only orbit in certain orbits with specific energies.</li>
    <li>Electrons would only emit (or absorb) photons when they jumped from one energy level to another</li>
    <li>Atoms can only emit certain (discrete) wavelengths that have photon energies corresponding to the <em>difference</em> between electron energy levels.</li>
    <li>The calculated energy levels correctly predict the emission spectrum for hydrogen.</li>
    <li>Atoms with more than one electron are more complicated due to the repulsion between electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>De Broglie hypothesized that <em class="Defn">wave-particle duality</em> applies to electrons and other particles, which have a <em class="Defn">de Broglie wavelength</em>:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\lambda = \frac{h}{p}</p>
<ul>
    <li>If we treat the orbiting electron in the atom as a wave, a <em class="Defn">stationary state</em> (that would not emit EMR) can only occur when the circumference of the orbit is an exact multiple of the de Broglie wavelength:
        <p class="TeX">2\pi r = n\left(\frac{h}{p}\right)</p></li>
    <li>This explains why the angular momentum is quantized!
        <p class="TeX">rp = n\left(\frac{h}{2\pi}\right)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Direct evidence that electrons can behave as waves comes from interference patterns that occur with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Diffraction of electrons from a crystal, as observed by Davisson and Germer;</li>
    <li>Double-slit experiments, similar to Young’s experiments with light.</li>
</ul>
