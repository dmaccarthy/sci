<section class="Slide"><h3>Dalton’s “Billiard Ball” Model</h3>
<p>The philosophers of ancient India and Greece reasoned that matter must be made of small building blocks that cannot be cut into smaller pieces.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Democritus called these indivisible pieces of matter <em class="Defn">atoms</em>.</li>
    <li>John Dalton introduced the idea of atoms into modern science in 1803.</li>
    <li>Dalton envisioned atoms as small spheres, with different elements distinguishable by the size of the sphere.</li>
    <li>Dalton’s model explains why compounds are formed with particular ratios of elements.</li>
    <li>For example, if water molecules are made from two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen (H<sub>2</sub>O), this would explain why decomposition of water always produces twice as much hydrogen gas by volume.</li>
    <li>Dalton’s hard sphere or “billiard ball” model was also used successfully to derive the kinetic molecular theory of gases, which explains the ideal gas law, for example.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Thomson’s “Raisin Bun” Model</h3>
<p>Once scientists realized that matter contained positive and negative charges, it became necessary to revise the model.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Thomson’s CRT experiment had shown that the negative particles were much smaller than the positive parts.</li>
    <li>Thomson also showed that the negative parts (now called <em class="Defn">electrons</em>) were the same in all elements, but the positive parts were different.</li>
    <li>He proposed the <em class="Defn">raisin bun</em> (also called the <em class="Defn">plum pudding</em>) model, in which small negative particles (electrons) are embedded in a positively charged sphere, like raisins in a bun.
        <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#bun"></svg></p>
    </li>
    <li>In Thomson’s model, elements differ by the size of the atom, and also by the number of electrons.</li>
</ul>   
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Alpha Scattering Experiment</h3>
<p>To test whether Thomson’s Raisin Bun Model of the atom was accurate, Ernest Rutherford and his students, Geiger and Marsden, conducted the <em class="Defn">alpha scattering experiment</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alpha particles are small, positively charged particles that are emitted at high speeds by radioactive materials such as radium and uranium. (It was later discovered that alpha particles are just the nuclei of helium-4 atoms.)</li>
    <li>Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden fired alpha particles at a thin gold foil.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img class="w20" alt="Alpha Scattering" src="p30/atom/img/alpha.webp"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>If Thomson’s model was correct, the mass and charge in the gold foil should be spread out uniformly, and the foil should affect all of the alpha particles in approximately the same way.</li>
    <li>This is not what actually happened!</li>
    <li>When Geiger and Marsden observed where the alpha particles hit a fluorescent screen, they observed that <em>most</em> of the alpha particles were not affected by the foil.</li>
    <li><b>But</b>... a few scattered to very large angles!
        <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#bun_alpha"></svg></p>
    </li>
    <li>Rutherford concluded that the Raisin Bun Model could not be correct but it could not explain this behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</section>
    
<section class="Slide"><h3>Planetary Model</h3>
<p>Rutherford developed the <em class="Defn">Planetary Model</em> to explain the results of the alpha scattering experiment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In Rutherford’s model, the positive charge is concentrated in a small but massive central volume called the <em>nucleus</em>.</li>
    <li>The much smaller electrons orbit around the nucleus like the planets around the Sun.</li>
    <li>The electric attraction between the positive nucleus and negative electrons produces the necessary centripetal acceleration.</li>
    <li>Most of the atom’s volume is empty space.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#nuclear_alpha"></svg></p>
<!-- <p class="Center"><img class="w12" alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Gold_foil_experiment_conclusions.svg/432px-Gold_foil_experiment_conclusions.svg.png"/></p> -->
<ul>
    <li>Most of the alpha particles were undeflected because they only passed through empty space.</li>
    <li>A small fraction of alpha particles passed close enough to the nucleus to experience a much larger deflection.</li>
    <li>Rutherford calculated the distribution of scattering angles, assuming the nucleus and alpha particles acted like very small positive spheres repelling each other according to Coulomb’s Law. His results matched the experimental data!</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Nuclear Size</h3>
<p>The size of the entire atom can be estimated at around <span class="TeX">10^{-10}\ \rm{m}</span> for smaller elements, based on the density of common solids or liquids.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rutherford and his colleagues redid the experiment using a smaller atom than gold (e.g. aluminum)</li>
    <li>The data still matched Rutherford’s calculations <em>for low kinetic energies</em>.</li>
    <li>Once the alpha particle energy gets large enough, those particles are able to pass <em>into</em> the nucleus, causing Rutherford’s calculations to no longer be correct.</li>
    <li>Using the kinetic energy at which this happens, Rutherford estimated the size of the nucleus to be around <span class="TeX">10^{-15}\ \rm{m}</span> for the smallest elements and about <span class="TeX">10^{-14}\ \rm{m}</span> for the largest ones.</li>
</ul>
