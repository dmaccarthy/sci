<section id="ph" class="Slide"><h3>Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
<p>We saw earlier that EMR exhibits <em class="Defn">wave-particle duality</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>EM <em>waves</em> behave according to Maxwell’s model and Huygen’s Principle.</li>
    <li>Wave-like behaviour includes interference phenomena like diffraction.</li>
    <li>EM <em>particles</em> (<em>photons</em>) behave according to Einstein’s model.</li>
    <li>Particle-like behaviour includes the photoelectric and Compton effects.</li>
    <li>Shorter wavelengths tends to be more particle-like, for example by diffracting less.</li>
    <li>Because x-rays have such short wavelengths, they can usually be treated as particles.</li>
    <li>To make an x-ray behave as a wave, we would need to use a “diffraction grating” with a slit spacing comparable to the size of a single atom.</li>
    <li>Crystals are regular arrangements of atoms that can be used like a diffraction grating but produce more complicated 3D interference patterns.</li>
</ul>

<section id="deB" class="Slide"><h3>De Broglie’s Hypothesis</h3>
<p>De Broglie proposed that wave-particle duality applies to <em>matter</em> (electrons, protons, neutrons) as well as to EMR!</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Photons obey the relations:
        <p class="TeX">E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = cp</p></li>
    <li>If we cancel the speed of light:
        <p class="TeX">\frac{h}{\lambda} = p</p>
        <p class="TeX">\lambda = \frac{h}{p}</p></li>
    <li>This is called the <em class="Defn">de Broglie wavelength</em> and de Broglie suggested that it applies to all particles, not just photons.</li>
</ul>

<section id="ex1" class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron in a cathode ray beam after being accelerated by a 1000-volt potential difference.</p>
<p>First use the potential difference to determine the speed of the electrons:
    <p class="TeX">qV = \Delta E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</p></p>
<p>
    <p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} = \mathrm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 1.60\times 10^{-19}\ C \cdot 1000\ V}{9.11\times 10^{-31}\ kg}}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">v = \mathrm{1.87\times 10^7\ m/s}</p>
</p>
<p>Now calculate the wavelength:
    <p class="TeX">\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{mv} = \mathrm{\frac{6.63\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s}{9.11\times 10^{-31}\ kg\cdot 1.87\times 10^7\ m/s}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\lambda = \mathrm{3.88\times 10^{-11}\ m}</p>
</p>
<p>This is very short, similar to the wavelength of an x-ray and the size of an atom. Electrons tend to behave as particles on everyday scales but as waves on atomic scales.</p>

<section id="DG" class="Slide"><h3>Electrons as Waves</h3>
<p>A regular arrangement of atoms (i.e. a crystal) can be used as a 3D diffraction grating to produce an interference pattern from very short waves like x-rays.</p>

<ul>
    <li>William and Lawrence Bragg had developed this technique (using x-rays) to study the structure of crystals.</li>
    <li>In 1927, Davisson and Germer were able to demonstrate that an electron beam incident on a nickel crystal produced an interference pattern too!</li>

<ul>
    <li>Interference indicates the electrons are acting like waves.</li>
    <li>More recent experiments have demonstrated that electrons exhibit the same behaviour as light in a double-slit experiment, provided the slit spacing is small enough.</li>
    <li>Everyday objects (people, cars, basketballs, planets) can safely be treated as particles all the time because their de Broglie wavelengths are very much shorter than the size of the objects themselves.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Q" class="Slide"><h3>Quantum Physics</h3>
<p>The branch of physics known as <em class="Defn">quantum mechanics</em> attempts to resolve the apparent contradiction of wave-particle duality.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the standard interpretation (first suggested by Max Born), a particle’s “position” is not an exact location, but a <em>probability distribution</em>.</li>
    <li>The “wave” associated with any particle determines its probability distribution.</li>
    <li>This interpretation of wave-particle duality is born out by the quantum version of Young’s double-slit experiment.</li>
    <li>When the intensity of the light is reduced to a single photon at a time, the location where the photon hits the screen is random, but obeys a probability distribution described by the interference pattern observed in Young’s original (many photons at once!) experiment.</li>
    <li>This probabilistic way of looking at mechanics applies to other variables (e.g. energy and momentum) as well as position.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</em> states that as a particle’s location becomes less uncertain, its momentum becomes more uncertain.</li>
</ul>
