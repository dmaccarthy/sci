<section class="Slide"><h3>EM Waves</h3>
<p>Maxwell’s Theory describes electromagnetic radiation (EMR) as <em>waves</em> made up of electric and magnetic fields.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The fields <em>generate each other</em> according to Faraday’s and Maxwell’s Laws.</li>
    <li>EM waves travel in vacuum at a speed of 3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.</li>
    <li>Michelson measured the speed of light to be 3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.</li>
    <li>Young’s double-slit experiment shows that light exhibits constructive and destructive interference.</li>
    <li>Light exhibits other wave behaviours such as diffraction, refraction, and the Doppler Effect.</li>
    <li>This eveidence leads scientists to conclude that light is an EM wave.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Photons</h3>
<p>Albert Einstein proposed that EMR exhibited <em class="Defn">wave-particle duality</em>...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Light sometimes behaves like waves (as described above) and sometimes behaves like it is made of <em>particles</em>.</li>
    <li>Particles of EMR are called <em class="Defn">photons</em>.</li>
    <li>Photons travel at the speed of light, <span class="TeX">c = \rm 3.00\times 10^8\ m/s</span>.</li>
    <li>Photons have no mass and no inertia.</li>
    <li>Photons cannot be accelerated or decelerated, but they can be absorbed and emitted by accelerating charged particles.</li>
    <li>Photons <b>do</b> have energy and momentum.</b></li>
    <li>According to Einstein, the Newtonian formulas <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf p} = m\vec{\bf v}</span> and <span class="TeX">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</span> only apply at speeds that are much slower than <span class="TeX">c</span>.</li>
    <li>Einstein’s theory of relativity argues that particles with no mass can still have momentum! The relationships between the wavelength and frequency of the EM wave and the energy and momentum of each photon are:
        <p class="TeX">E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = cp</p></li>
    <li>The constant <span class="TeX">h</span> is known as <em class="Defn">Planck’s constant</em>:
        <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">h = \rm{6.63\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15}\ eV\cdot s}</p></li>
    <li>Einstein proposed this photon theory in order to explain two phenomena that could not be properly explained using Maxwell’s wave theory: (1) the blackbody radiation spectrum, and (2) the photoelectric effect (which we will discuss in the next lesson).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p class="Blue" data-cue="prev">Calculate the energy and momentum of each photon of red light at 632 nm.</p>
    <p class="TeX">E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \rm{\frac{(6.63\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s) (3.00\times 10^8\ m/s)}{6.32\times 10^{-7}\ m}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">E = \rm 3.15\times 10^{-19}\ J</p>
    <p>If we want the answer in electron-volts, we can divide by <span class="TeX">\rm 1.60\times 10^{-19}\ J/eV</span>, or we could redo the above calculation using <span class="TeX">h = \rm 4.14\times 10^{-15}\ eV\cdot s</span>...</p>
    <p class="TeX">E = \rm \frac{3.15\times 10^{-19}\ J}{1.60\times 10^{-19}\ J/eV} = 1.97\ eV</p>
    <p>When calculating the momentum, we <em>must</em> use the energy in the standard SI unit, J...</p>
    <p class="TeX">E = cp</p>
    <p class="TeX">p = \frac{E}{c} = \rm{\frac{3.15\times 10^{-19}\ J}{3.00\times 10^8\ m/s}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">p = \rm{1.05\times 10^{-27}\ N\cdot s}</p>
</section>
    
<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p class="Blue" data-cue="prev">Calculate the frequency and wavelength of a photon with an energy of 40.0 meV.</p>
    <p class="TeX">E = hf</p>
    <p>Since the energy is given using electron-volts, it is simplest to use the value of <span class="TeX">h</span> in eV·s so that eV cancels...</p>
    <p class="TeX">f = \frac{E}{h} = \rm{\frac{0.0400\ eV}{4.14\times 10^{-15}\ eV\cdot s} = 9.66\times 10^{12}\ Hz}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\lambda =\frac{c}{f} = \rm{\frac{3.00\times 10^8\ m/s}{9.66\times 10^{12}\ Hz} = 3.11\times 10^{-5}\ m}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Quantization</h3>
<p>One of the consequences of the photon theory is that the energy of an EM wave is <em class="Defn">quantized</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The smallest amount of energy that an EM wave can have is <span class="TeX">hf</span>, the energy of a single photon.</li>
    <li>The <em>total</em> energy of an EM wave will be a <em>multiple</em> of <span class="TeX">hf</span>, since the number of photons must be a whole number.</li>
    <li>Another quantity that is quantized is electic charge; because it is carried by electrons and protons, total charge is always a multiple of <span class="TeX">e</span>.</li>
    <li>Even before Einstein developed the photon theory, Max Planck had hypothesized that the energy of EM waves was quantized.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Planck’s Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Scientists at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century were unable to explain the blackbody spectrum we studied in the last lesson.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Their calculations (known as the Rayleigh-Jeans Law, plotted in red below) indicated that the intensity should keep increasing to infinity at shorter wavelengths. This was called the <em class="Defn">ultraviolet catastrophe</em>.</li>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><svg class="s22" data-svg2="p30/photon/img/bbr.js#r_j"></svg></p>
    <li>In reality the intensity reaches a peak and then decreases gradually to zero, as plotted in blue.</li>
    <li>Planck realized that energy quantization could resolve the problem...</li>
    <li>If the quantum of energy is <span class="TeX">hf</span>, Planck argued, it would take a lot of energy to emit high frequency (short wavelength) EMR.</li>
    <li>These wavelengths would only be emitted at very high temperatures (Wien’s Law!) when the colliding molecules have sufficient energy.</li>
    <li>At lower temperatures, most molecules would not have enough energy to emit even a single photon of short wavelength EMR.</li>
    <li>For example, at room temperature an average molecule has about 0.040 electron-volts of kinetic energy, while producing a single red photon at 632 nm requires 1.97 eV of energy.</li>
    <li>It is extremely unlikely that colliding molecules at room temperature would have enough energy to emit a visible or ultraviolet photon.</li>
    <li>Planck repeated the calculations that other scientists had made, adding his assumption the EM waves had an energy quantum of <span class="TeX">hf</span>.</li>
    <li>His results agreed with the observed blackbody spectrum!</li>
    <li>Planck determined that the value of the constant <span class="TeX">h</span> must be <span class="TeX">\rm{6.63\times 10^{-34}\ J\cdot s}</span> for the peak of his calculated blackbody spectrum to agree with the observed spectrum, as described by Wien’s Law.</li>
</ul>
