<section class="Slide"><h3>Motor Principle</h3>
<p>We’ve seen that a uniform magnetic field causes a free moving charged particle to move in uniform circular (if <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf v} \perp \vec{\bf B}</span>) or helical motion.</p>
<p data-cue="+">What effect does a magnetic field have on a coil?</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Because the direction of the electron flow is different on opposite sides of the coil, the two sides will experience opposite magnetic forces.
        <p class="Center"><img class="w24" src="p30/mag/img/mp.png" alt="Coil"/></p>
    </li>
    <li data-cue="+">The net magnetic force on the coil will be zero if the field is uniform because the forces will balance.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">However, the two forces cause the coil to rotate.  In the illustration above, the opposing forces would cause a clock-wise rotation.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The electric energy being supplied to the coil is being converted into rotational mechanical energy.  A device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy is called a <em class="Defn">motor</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The <em class="Defn">Motor Principle</em> states: a dipole magnet (coil or bar magnet) placed in a uniform magnetic field will tend to rotate to align its North Pole in the same direction as the external magnetic field.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The Motor Principle explains why a compass needle rotates to point “North”.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">To make a workable electric motor, we must keep the coil rotating as long as the current is turned on.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">To prevent the coil from stopping once its North Pole aligns with the external magnetic field, we must reverse the current direction in the coil every 180º.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">This is accomplished using <em class="Defn">split-ring commutators</em>.

    </li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Galvanometer</h3>
<p>Another device that uses the Motor Principle is a <em class="Defn">galvanometer</em>.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w18" src="p30/mag/img/galvan.png" alt="Coil"/></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>A galvanometer consists of a coil attached to a spring and placed in a magnetic field.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When electric current is run through the coil, the spring will stretch as the coil attempts to align with the external magnetic field.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">As more current passes through the coil, the spring will stretch more.  A galvanometer can be used to measure electric current.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Ammeters and voltmeters are based on the galvanometer.</li>
</ul>
