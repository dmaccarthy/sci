<section class="Slide"><h3>Electric Current</h3>
<p>A flow of electric charge is called an <em class="Defn">electric current</em>.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Current (<span class="TeX">I</span>) is defined mathematically as:<p class="TeX">I = {\Delta Q\over\Delta t}</p></li>
    <li data-cue="+">The SI unit of current is the ampere (A = C/s).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Electromagnetism</h3>
<p>Hans Christian Oersted discovered that electric currents deflected the needle of a magnetic compass. This phenomenon is called <em class="Defn">electromagnetism</em>.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li><em class="Defn">Magnetism</em> refers to a force that acts between electric charges only when the charges are in <em>motion</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">This “magnetic force” is <u>in addition to</u> the electric force that acts between charges even when they are not moving.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Some materials have magnetic properties:</li>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Materials that can be permanently magnetized are called <em class="Defn">ferromagnetic</em>. Iron and nickel are two of the most common ferromagnetic materials.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">By contrast, <em class="Defn">paramagnetic</em> materials become magnetized when another magnet is nearby, but return to being unmagnetized when the nearby magnet is removed.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Magnetic Fields</h3>
<p>As with gravitational and electric forces, physicists use the concept of a <em class="Defn">field</em> to understand how magnetic forces work.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Moving charges (i.e. electric currents) produce a magnetic field. This magnetic field then exerts a magnetic force on other nearby moving charges.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The symbol for magnetic field is <span class="TeX">{\vec{\mathbf B}}</span>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The SI unit is the tesla: T = N / (A·m).</li>
    <li data-cue="+">A diagram of a magnetic field illustrates the direction that a compass needle will point when placed at each position within the field.
        <p class="Center"><a target="WC" title="Click for image credit" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_cylindrical_coil_real.svg"><img class="w18 s24" alt="Second Hand Rule" src="p30/mag/img/2HR.svg"/></a></p>
    </li>
    <li data-cue="+">As with electric and gravitational field diagrams, the strength of the field corresponds to the density of field lines.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Like gravitational and electric fields, magnetic field is a vector.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">A unique property of magnetic fields is that there are no points of convergence or divergence: magnetic field lines always form closed loops with no beginning or end!</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The crosses in the diagram indicate a wire with a flow of electons away (into the page).</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The dots in the diagram indicate a wire with a flow of electons toward (out of the page).</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Ampere’s Law</em> states that the strength of a magnetic field is directly proportional to the current that produces it.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Doubling the current flowing through a wire will double the magnetic field strength.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Measuring Magnetic Fields</h3>
<p>While a compass will show the direction of the magnetic field, it is not an adequate device for making scientific measurements.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>A compass does not allow for measurement of the magnitude of the magnetic field.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Since a compass needle often floats in water, it can only detect the horizontal component of the field.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Strong magnetic fields may change the magnetization of a compass needle, making it unreliable even for measuring directions.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Magnetic fields are measured using the “Hall Effect”.
        <p class="Center"><img class="w18 s24" alt="Diagram" src="p30/mag/img/hall.jpg"/></p>
    </li>
    <li data-cue="+">When there is a magnetic field present, it causes the moving electrons in a current to be pushed toward one side of the wire.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">This results in one side of the wire becoming positive and one side becoming negative.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The potential difference between the two sides of the wire tells us how strong the magnetic field is.</li>
</ul>
