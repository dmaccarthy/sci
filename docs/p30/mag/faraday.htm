<section class="Slide"><h3>EM Induction</h3>
<p>A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.</p>
<p>A <em class="Defn">generator</em> converts mechanical energy into electrical energy!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generators use magnetic forces to transform energy.</li>
    <li>The mechanism for this energy transformation was discovered by Michael Faraday and is called <em class="Defn">electromagnetic induction</em> (i.e. “inducing” electric forces by the use of magnetism).</li>
    <li>The illustration below shows a simple generator.
        <p class="Center"><img class="w20" src="p30/mag/img/gen.png" alt="Generator"/></p>
    </li>
    <li>A conductor is moved through a magnetic field.</li>
    <li>The magnetic force (which can be determined using the Third Hand Rule) pushes electrons to one end of the conductor, making it negative and the other end positive.</li>
    <li>Electric potential energy has been produced!</li>
    <li>The ends of the conductor can be used as positive and negative terminals (just like a battery) to power a circuit.</li>
    <li>The voltage produced by a generator is often referred to as the “EMF” (<em class="Defn">electromotive force</em>).</li>
    <li>Note that EMF is not actually measuring force, but potential difference!</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Faraday’s Law</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Faraday’s Law</em> states that an EMF will be produced in a circuit if one or more of the following conditions is met:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The average magnetic field experienced by the circuit changes. (This can be accomplished by moving the circuit and the external magnet closer together or farther apart.)</li>
    <li>The angle between the field and the circuit changes. (This can be accomplished by rotating either the circuit or the magnet. Most practical generators use this method of generating an EMF.)</li>
    <li>The area of the circuit changes. (This requires changing the shape of the circuit.)</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Lenz’s Law</h3>
<p>Since energy is conserved, the gain of electrical energy must be accompanied by a loss of mechanical energy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This observation is known as <em class="Defn">Lenz’s Law</em>.</li>
    <li>The moving conductor (or magnet) must experience a magnetic force in the direction <em>opposite</em> to the motion whenever electrical energy is being generated.</li>
    <li>We can use this fact to determine the direction of the induced current.</li>
</ul> 
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example</h3>
<p class="Blue">Predict whether an EMF will be induced, and if so the location of the North pole and the direction of current flow when the coil is rotated clockwise through a magnetic field directed to the right.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg id="LenzAnim" class="w20" data-svg2="p30/mag/img/faraday.js#lenz_law"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>An EMF will be produced because the angle between the coil and <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf B}</span> is changing.</li>
    <li>The magnetic force must produce a <em>counterclockwise</em> torque to oppose the clockwise motion.</li>
    <li>The “top” of the solenoid is South because it is attracted to the North pole of the external magnet and the “bottom” is North because it is repelled.</li>
    <li>The Second Hand Rule gives the direction of the induced current, which tells us which end of the coil becomes negative and which becomes positive.</li>
    <li>Electrical energy is gained and the solenoid loses rotational energy as electrons move through the solenoid.</li>
    <li>As with a battery, electrons flow from – to + <em>inside</em> the source where electrical energy is <em>gained</em>, and from – to + <em>outside</em> of the source where electrical energy is <em>lost</em> to the loads connected into the circuit.</li>
</ul>
