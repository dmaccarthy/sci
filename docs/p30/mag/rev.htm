<p><em class="Defn">Magnetism</em> is a force that acts between moving charges (i.e. currents).</p>
<ul>
<li>Charges in motion produce both electric (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf E}</span>) and magnetic (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf B}</span>) fields.</li>
<li>Charges at rest produce <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf E}</span> only.</li>
<li><em class="Defn">Ampere’s Law</em> states that the magnetic field strength is directly proportional to the current that produces it.</li>
<li><em class="Defn">Gauss’s Law</em> states that magnetic fields form closed loops with no convergence or divergence points.</li>
<li>The direction of the magnetic field tells us the direction that the north end of a compass will point: it is not the direction of the magnetic force.</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">First Hand Rule</em>: The current in a long, straight wire produces a magnetic field pattern of circular loops centred on the wire.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point your left thumb in the direction of electron flow; your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field loops.</li>
    <li>Use your right hand instead when the source is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Second Hand Rule</em>: The current in a coil of wire produces a <em class="Defn">dipolar</em> magnetic field, similar to that of a bar magnet.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Curl your left fingers in the direction of electron flow; your thumb will point to the field’s “north” pole (defined as the direction that <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf B}</span> points along the loop’s axis.)</li>
    <li>Use your right hand when the source is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em class="Defn">Third Hand Rule</em> is used to find the <em>direction</em> of the magnetic force acting on a moving test charge or a current that is located within a magnetic field.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w16" src="p30/mag/img/3HR.png" alt="Magnetic Force"></p><ul>
    <li>Point your left thumb in the direction of the electron flow.</li>
    <li>Point your fingers in the direction of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf B}</span>.</li>
    <li>Your palm indicates the direction of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_m</span>, the magnetic force.</li>
    <li>Use your right hand when the test charge/current is made of positive charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>magnitude</em> of the <em class="Defn">magnetic force</em> acting on a moving test charge is:
    <p class="TeX">|\vec{\bf F}_m| = qvB_\perp</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is the equation for the magnetic force acting on a charge <span class="TeX">q</span> moving with speed <span class="TeX">v</span>.</li>
    <li>The direction of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_m</span> is given by the third hand rule.</li>
    <li>The subscript ⊥ is an abbreviation for <span class="TeX">\sin\theta</span>, where <span class="TeX">\theta</span> is the angle between the directions of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf B}</span> and <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}</span>.</li>
    <li>The total magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire is:
        <p class="TeX">|\vec{\bf F}_m| = ILB_\perp</p></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">I</span> is the current and <span class="TeX">L</span> is the length of wire within the magnetic field.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em class="Defn">motor principle</em> is the observation that a dipole magnet (e.g. a coil or bar magnet) will try to orient itself so its north pole aligns with the external magnetic field.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">DC motor</em> converts electrical energy into mechanical energy; the coil will rotate until it aligns with the external field.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">split-ring commutator</em> and <em class="Defn">brushes</em> are used to reverse the direction of the current whenever the coil reaches alignment; this keeps the motor spinning indefintely!</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">galvanometer</em> is another application of the motor principle;
        it measures the strength of the magnetic force trying to rotate the coil, which in turn tells us how much current is flowing through the coil.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <em class="Defn">generator</em> is the reverse of a motor; it uses magnetic forces to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The phenomenon of using magnetic fields to “induce” an <em class="Defn">electromotive force</em> (voltage) is called <em class="Defn">electromagnetic induction</em>.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Faraday’s Law</em> states that the EMF produced in a coil is equal to the rate at which the “magnetic flux” changes. This means that an EMF will be produced whenever one of the following variables for the coil changes:
        <ul>
            <li>the area of the coil</li>
            <li>the average magnetic field experienced by the coil</li>
            <li>the orientation of the coil relative to the field</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>According to <em class="Defn">Lenz’s Law</em>, when a current is induced it will experience a magnetic force in the <em>opposite</em> direction to the direction of motion.</li>
    <li>Lenz’s Law is simply the law of energy conservation applied to EM induction.</li>
    <li>Most generators consist of a coil of wire that is <em>rotated</em> through a magnetic field.</li>
    <!--li>When rotated with constant speed, the EMF varies as a sine function.</li-->
    <li>The direction of the induced current reverses every half turn of the coil: this is called <em class="Defn">alternating current</em>.</li>
    <li>A split-ring commutator and brushes can be used keep the direction of the current constant; however this is often unnecessay since many electrical devices operate on AC.</li>
</ul>
