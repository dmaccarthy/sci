<section class="Slide"><h3>Single Slit Diffraction</h3>
<p>In Young’s double-slit experiment, we saw that interference of light passing through two slits separated by a distance <span class="TeX">d</span>, could be described by an equation:</p>
<p class="TeX">\sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d}</p>
<ul>
    <li>The angles where the interference <em class="Defn">maxima</em> occur can be found by solving for <span class="TeX">\theta</span> when <span class="TeX">n</span> is a whole number (0, 1, 2, ...)</li>
    <li>The interference <em class="Defn">minima</em> occur where <span class="TeX">n</span> is a half number (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ...)</li>
    <li>Graphing the relative intensity of the light against <span class="TeX">n</span> produces the graph shown below in red...</li>
</ul>

<p>Another experiment we could do, would be to look at the interference produced by light passing through a <em>single, wide slit</em> of width <span class="TeX">d</span>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Interference happens, according to Huygens’ Principle, because each individual point along the opening acts as a source of wavelets, and the wavelets from each point overlap with the wavelets from all other points.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg class="s24" data-svg2="p30/emr/img/diff.js#huygens"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>The intensity of the interference pattern produced by the single wide slit is graphed above in blue.</li>
    <li>The most notable difference, is that the first, second, and higher order maxima are <em>much less intense</em> than the central maximum.</li>
    <li>Nearly all of the wave’s energy occurs within the central maximum.</li>
    <li>Except for <span class="TeX">n</span> = 0, which is a maximum for both patterns, the other maxima and minima are shifted by an additional 0.5...</li>
</ul>

<p>Scientists use the term <em class="Defn">diffraction</em> to describe the “spreading out” of waves as a result of interference as they pass by obstacles or through openings in a barrier.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For a double-slit experiment where the slits have a finite width, <em>both</em> interference patterns occur: dots due to the double-slit with the intensity modulated by the wide slit diffraction.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In the photo above, the first-order wide-slit minimum (bottom numbers) coincides with the 7<sup>th</sup>-order double-slit maximum (top numbers). This indicates that the width of the slits is about 1/7<sup>th</sup> of the slit separation.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example</h3>
<p class="Blue">Estimate how much the following waves “spread out” as they pass through an 80.0 cm wide door...</p>
<p class="Blue">A “treble” sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 20.0\ \mathrm{cm}</span></p>
<p>Calculate the location of the first minimum at <span class="TeX">n</span> = 1...</p>
<p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{20.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 14.5^\circ</p>
<p>Nearly all of the diffracted wave’s energy would be found within 14.5° of centre, with very low intensity at larger angles.</p>
<p class="Blue">A mid-range sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 60.0\ \mathrm{cm}</span></p>
<p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{60.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 48.6^\circ</p>
<p class="Blue">A “bass” sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 2.00\ \mathrm{m}</span></p>
<p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{200\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = \mathrm{No\ Solution!}</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the wavelength is larger than the opening, there is no solution for the first minimum at <span class="TeX">n=1</span>; this means the wave diffracts (spreads out) completely!</li>
    <li>Larger wavelengths are better at diffracting than smaller wavelengths.</li>
    <li>This is why we can hear the bass better than the treble when music is playing in a different room.</li>
    <li>AM radio (longer <span class="TeX">\lambda</span>) travels better than FM.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Blue">A light wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 500\ \mathrm{nm}</span></p>
<p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{5.00\times 10^{-7}\ m}{0.800\ m}} = (3.58\times 10^{-5})^\circ</p>
<ul>
    <li>The wavelength of visible light is so small that it essentially travels in stright lines with negligible diffraction, unless the opening is extremely narrow.</li>
    <li>When scientists assume light moves in straight lines without diffraction, we call this the <em class="Defn">ray model</em>.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>When light from a point source passes through an opening (like the pupil of your eye or the lens of a telescope), diffraction causes the light to spread out.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w32" data-aspect="1152/351" src="p30/emr/img/rayleigh.png" alt="Overlap"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>When two point sources are far enough apart, the light will strike your retina in such a way that you can <em class="Defn">resolve</em> two separate sources.</li>
    <li>When the sources get too close together, the diffraction patterns will overlap and you will no longer be able to resolve the sources.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><iframe data-aspect="2" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ob4yihwvli?embed" width="640" height="320" class="s32" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe></p>
<ul>
    <li>We can make a rough estimate of how far apart the sources must be to resolve them:
        <p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}</p></li>
    <li>A more accurate equation for resolving two sources, that accounts for the circular shape of the lens, is called the <em class="Defn">Rayleigh criterion</em>:<p class="TeX">\theta \approx \left(1.22\ \frac{\lambda}{d}\right) \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Astronomers prefer very large telescopes (big <span class="TeX">d</span>) because that lets them resolve smaller angles.</li>
</ul>
