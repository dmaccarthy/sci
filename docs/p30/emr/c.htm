<section class="Slide"><h3>Galileo’s Attempt</h3>
<!--Maxwell’s theory of EMR proposes that light is a wave traveling with a speed of <span class="TeX">3.00\times 10^8\ \rm{m/s}</span> and consisting of electromagnetic fields.-->
<p>One of the earliest attempts to measure the speed of light was made by Galileo.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Galileo’s method was to uncover a lantern; when an assistant saw the light from the lantern, the assistant uncovered his own lantern.</li>
    <li>Galileo used his own pulse rate to try to time how long it took the light to travel from his lantern to his assistant and back.</li>
    <li>Galileo concluded that the speed of light was many times faster than sound, but he could not determine a numerical value because the reaction time of the two humans was much greater than the actual time it took the light to travel.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Rømer &amp; Huygens</h3>
<p>In the 17th century, astronomers observed that Jupiter’s moons had orbital periods that appeared to vary by as much as 22 minutes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ole Rømer interpreted this discrepancy as being caused by the extra distance that the light coming from Jupiter has to travel when Jupiter and Earth are moving apart.</li>
    <li>Christiaan Huygens used Rømer’s data to calculate the speed of light, obtaining a result within 10% of the modern value of <span class="TeX">3.00\times 10^8\ \rm{m/s}</span>.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Fizeau’s Method</h3>
<p>Galileo’s method has been improved upon by using a mirror to reflect the light (eliminating the reaction time).</p>
<p>More accurate methods of timing have also improved on speed of light measurements...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hippolyte Fizeau (1849) used a rotating “toothed-wheel” as a timing device.</li>

    </a></p>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>When the wheel rotates slowly, the incident light passes through one of the gaps, but the reflected light is blocked by the adjacent tooth.</li>
    <li>When the wheel is spun fast enough, the reflected light will pass through the gap <em>adjacent</em> to the one where the incident light passed, as illustrated above.</li>
    <li>The time it takes the light to travel from the wheel to the mirror and back is <span class="TeX">T/N</span>, where <span class="TeX">T</span> is the rotational period of the wheel and <span class="TeX">N</span> is the number of teeth.</li>
    <li>Fizeau also conducted his experiment enclosed in a pipe filled with water.</li>
    <li>The results showed that light waves travel more slowly in water than in air or vacuum.</li>
    <li>The ratio of the vacuum speed of light (<span class="TeX">c</span>) to the speed of light in a particular medium (<span class="TeX">v</span>) is called the <em class="Defn">index of refraction</em>:
        <p class="TeX">n = \frac{c}{v}</p></li>
    <li>The index of refraction (also called the refractive index) is represented by the symbol <span class="TeX">n</span>.</li>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Michelson’s Method</h3>
<p>A similar experiment, invented by Léon Foucault and refined by A.A. Michelson, uses a <em>rotating mirror</em> in place of the toothed-wheel.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w24" src="p30/emr/img/michelson.png" alt="Michelson"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>In Michelson’s experiment, a light beam is first reflected from an eight-sided mirror.</li>
    <li>A distant plane mirror reflects the light back toward the eight-sided mirror where it reflects again, and enters a detector.</li>
    <li>If the 8-sided mirror is rotated even a small amount, the path of the light beam will change and the light will miss the detector...</li>
    <li>...unless the mirror rotates exactly 45º (1/8th of a full rotation) in exactly the time it takes the light to travel to the plane mirror and back.</li>
    <li>When this happens, the rotating mirror will be in the same position when the light strikes it the second time as it was the first time and the reflected beam will strike the detector.</li>
    <li>For the experiment to work, the plane mirror must be much further away than illustrated.</li>
    <li>The speed of light is so fast that if the mirrors are too close together, we won’t be able to spin the rotating one fast enough to move 45º before the light beam returns.</li>
    <li>Michelson’s plane mirror was about 35 kilometres from his rotating apparatus!</li>
    <li>When the mirrors are this far apart, the line segments labelled <span class="TeX">a</span> and <span class="TeX">b</span> in the diagram become parallel and have identical lengths <span class="TeX">L</span>.</li>
    <li>The angles <span class="TeX">\alpha</span> and <span class="TeX">\beta</span> both become 90º, meaning that the detector will be in line with the original incident light beam.</li>
    <li>The experiment can be done with 12- or 16-sided mirrors too. Multiples of 4 work best for the number of sides because each side will be at a 90º angle to two of the other sides.</li>
    <li>The speed of light (<span class="TeX">c</span>) can be determined using<p class="TeX">c = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{2L}{T/8}</p></li>
    <li>The numerator (<span class="TeX">2L</span>) is the return-trip distance the light travels, and the denominator is the time it takes the mirror to rotate 1/8th of a complete turn.</li>
    <li>If we use a 12- or 16-sided mirror, we would have to change 8 to 12 or 16.</li>
</ul>
