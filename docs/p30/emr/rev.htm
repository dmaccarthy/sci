<p><em class="Defn">Faraday’s Law</em> states that a <em>changing</em> magnetic field produces an electric field. <em class="Defn">Maxwell’s Law</em> proposes that the reverse is also true: a changing electric field generates a magnetic field.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The consequence of Maxwell’s Law is <em class="Defn">electromagnetic radiation (EMR)</em>.</li>
    <li>Once the initial field starts to change (because of non-steady currents / accelerating charges), <span class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf E}</span> and <span class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf B}</span> will <em>generate each other</em> and propagate as EMR.</li>
    <li>Using some advanced math, Maxwell showed that EMR behaves as waves that travel at a speed of <span class="TeX">c = 3.00\times 10^8\ \mathrm{m/s}</span>.</li>
    <li>The wave comprises electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">electromagnetic spectrum</em> includes:</li>

<p>Visible light is an EM wave because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Light travels at the same speed predicted by Maxwell, as measured by Rømer &amp; Huygens, Fizeau, and especially <em class="Defn">Michelson’s experiment</em> with an <span class="TeX">N</span>-sided rotating mirror:
        <p class="TeX">c = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{2L}{\frac{1}{N} T}</p></li>
    <li>Light travels slower through a medium than it does in vacuum depending on the medium’s <em class="Defn">index of refraction</em>, <span class="TeX">n</span>:
        <p class="TeX">v=\frac{c}{n}</p></li>
    <li>Light exhibits an interference pattern in <em class="Defn">Young’s double-slit experiment</em>.</li>
    <li>The interference pattern can be explained by Huygen’s principle, and leads to the result that the maxima (anti-nodes) and minima (nodes) are located at angles <span class="TeX">\theta</span> from the central maximum, where:
        <p class="TeX">\sin\theta=\frac{n\lambda}{d}</p></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">d</span> is the distance between the two slits.</li>
    <li>Whole number values of <span class="TeX">n</span> identify the maxima and half numbers (0.5, 1.5, etc.) identify the minima.</li>
    <li>We can use this result to measure the wavelength of the light observed through a diffraction grating, and to separate light into its individual wavelengths in a <em class="Defn">spectroscope</em>:
        <p class="TeX">\lambda = \frac{d\sin\theta}{n}</p></li>
</ul>   

<p><em class="Defn">Diffraction</em> is the phenomenon of waves bending or spreading out once they pass through an opening in a barrier.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each point on the opening must be treated as a source, according to Huygen’s principle.</li>
    <li>The interfrence pattern has maxima and minima described by the same equation as the double-slit experiment, except that the minima occur at the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the maxima occur at 0, 1.5, 2.5, etc.</li>
    <li>Nearly all of the diffracted wave’s energy falls within the central maxima, as the other maxima have much smaller amplitudes.</li>
    <li>Wavelengths larger than the size of the opening diffract completely.</li>
    <li>Wavelengths much smaller than the opening hardly diffract at all.</li>
    <li>Because of its small wavelength, visible light can be treated as moving in straight lines (the <em class="Defn">ray model</em>) except when passing through openings that are extremely small.</li>
    <li>Diffraction limits the ability of optical devices (microscopes, telescopes, your eye) to <em class="Defn">resolve</em> two sources that are close together, as their diffraction patterns will overlap.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a wave reaches a boundary between two media, Huygen’s principle states that the points along the boundary should be treated as sources.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Part of the wave’s energy will be <em class="Defn">reflected</em> back into the original medium, and part will be transmitted or <em class="Defn">refracted</em> into the new medium.</li>
    <li>The reflected and refracted waves must have the same frequency.</li>
    <li>The wavelength and direction of the wave will change depending on the speed of the wave in the two media according to <em class="Defn">Snell’s Law</em>:
        <p class="TeX">\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}</p></li>
    <li>Angles of incidence and refraction are measured between the <em class="Defn">normal</em> to the boundary and the direction of the wave’s propagation.</li>
    <li>When a wave passes from a slower to a faster medium, there will be a <em class="Defn">critical angle</em> for <span class="TeX">\theta_1</span> at which <span class="TeX">\theta_2 = 90^\circ</span>.</li>
    <li>When the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, <em class="Defn">total internal reflection</em> occurs; the wave is completed reflected and no refracted wave exists.</li>
</ul>
