<section id="dif" class="Slide"><h3>Single Opening Diffraction</h3>
<p>Scientists use the term <em class="Defn">diffraction</em> to describe the interference behaviour of waves as they pass by obstacles or through openings in a barrier.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>In the last lesson, we studied the interference pattern produced by two narrow slits.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Because the slits were narrow, we could treat them as <em>point</em> sources in applying Huygens’ Principle.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Our result was that an interference maximum would occur at any point where the path difference to the two point sources was a multiple of the wavelength:
        <p class="TeX">d\sin\theta = n\lambda</p></li>
</ul>

<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>A <em>single, wide</em> slit cannot be treated as only two point sources. Huygens’ Principle requires us to consider not just the two endpoints but <em>all</em> of the points in between as sources.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When point <span class="TeX">P</span> has a path difference of one wavelength, the wavelets from the two endpoints interfere constructively; <span class="TeX">P</span> would be on the first-order maximum if this were a two-slit experiment.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When we add up the wavelets not just from the two endpoints of the opening, but of <b>all</b> points in between as well, the interference is <em>destructuve</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The equation from the two-source interference is still applicable, but its interpretation is different.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">For a single wide opening, the interference is <em>destructive</em> when <span class="TeX">n</span> is a natural number.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The interference is <em>contructive</em> when <span class="TeX">n</span> is 1.5, 2.5, etc.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The interference is still <em>contructive</em> when <span class="TeX">n = 0</span>!</li>
    <li data-cue="+">At <span class="TeX">n = 0.5</span>, there is neither a maximum nor a minimum.</li>
</ul>

    <img src="img/single.jpg" alt="Interference" class="w24"/></a></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The maximum at <span class="TeX">n=1.5</span> is only about 1/9<sup>th</sup> as intense as the central maximum.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The maximum at <span class="TeX">n=2.5</span> is only about 1/25<sup>th</sup> as intense as the central maximum.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Nearly all of the wave’s energy is found within the central maximum.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">For a double-slit experiment where the slits have a finite width, <em>both</em> interference patterns occur: dots due to the double-slit with the intensity modulated by the wide slit diffraction.</li>
</ul>

<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>In the photo above, the first-order wide-slit minimum (bottom numbers) coincides with the 7<sup>th</sup>-order double-slit maximum (top numbers). This indicates that the width of the slits is about 1/7<sup>th</sup> of the slit separation.</li>

<section id="ex1" class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Estimate how much the following waves “spread out” as they pass through an 80.0 cm wide door...</p>
<p class="Blue">A “treble” sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 20.0\ \mathrm{cm}</span></p>
<p data-cue="+"><p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{20.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 14.5^\circ</p></p>
<p data-cue="+" class="Blue">A mid-range sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 60.0\ \mathrm{cm}</span></p>
<p data-cue="+"><p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{60.0\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = 48.6^\circ</p></p>
<p data-cue="+" class="Blue">A “bass” sound wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 2.00\ \mathrm{m}</span></p>
<p data-cue="+"><p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{200\ cm}{80.0\ cm}} = \mathrm{No\ Solution!}</p></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>When the wavelength is larger than the opening, there is no solution for the first minimum at <span class="TeX">n=1</span>; this means the wave diffracts completely!</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Larger wavelengths are better at diffracting than smaller wavelengths.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">This is why we can hear the bass better than the treble when music is playing in a different room.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">AM radio (longer <span class="TeX">\lambda</span>) travels better than FM.</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="+" class="Blue">A light wave with <span class="TeX">\lambda = 500\ \mathrm{nm}</span></p>
<p data-cue="+"><p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d} = \sin^{-1}\mathrm{\frac{5.00\times 10^{-7}\ m}{0.800\ m}} = (3.58\times 10^{-5})^\circ</p></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The wavelength of visible light is so small that it essentially travels in stright lines with negligible diffraction, unless the opening is extremely narrow.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When scientists assume light moves in straight lines without diffraction, we call this the <em class="Defn">ray model</em>.</li>

<section id="res" class="Slide"><h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>When light from a point source passes through an opening (like the pupil of your eye or the lens of a telescope), diffraction causes the light to spread out.</p>
<p data-cue="=" class="Center"><img class="w32" src="img/rayleigh.png" alt="Overlap"/></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>When two point sources are far enough apart, the light will strike your retina in such a way that you can <em class="Defn">resolve</em> two separate sources.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When the sources get too close together, the diffraction patterns will overlap and you will no longer be able to resolve the sources.</li>
</ul>

<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>We can make a rough estimate of how far apart the sources must be to resolve them:
        <p class="TeX">\theta = \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}</p></li>
    <li data-cue="+">A more accurate equation for resolving two sources, that accounts for the circular shape of the lens, is called the <em class="Defn">Rayleigh criterion</em>:<p class="TeX">\theta \approx 1.22\ \frac{\lambda}{d}</p></li>

    <li>Astronomers prefer very large telescopes (big <span class="TeX">d</span>) because that lets them resolve smaller angles.</li>
