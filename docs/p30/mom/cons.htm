    <li>A 3500 kg rail car moving at 15.0 km/h collides with another rail car and slows to 8.00 km/h as a result. How much impulse did the first rail car experience?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Calculate the initial and final momenta, remember to change km/h to the standard SI unit, m/s:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_i = m\vec{\bf v}_i = \rm 3500\ kg\cdot (+4.17\ m/s) = +14583\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_f = m\vec{\bf v}_f = \rm 3500\ kg\cdot (+2.22\ m/s) = +7778\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
        <p>The impulse is the <em>change</em> in momentum:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_f - \vec{\bf p}_i = \rm +7778\ kg\cdot m/s - (+14583\ kg\cdot m/s) = -6805\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
        <p>Rounded to 3 significant digits, the impulse is <span class="TeX">\rm -6.81\times 10^3\ kg\cdot m/s</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <li>If the collision lasted for 1.25 seconds, what was the average force that the two rail cars exerted on each other?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>For the first rail car:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf F}\Delta t</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \frac{\Delta\vec{\bf p}}{\Delta t} = \rm \frac{-6805\ kg\cdot m/s}{1.25\ s} = -5.44\times 10^3\ N</p>
        <p>The second rail car experiences the same magnitude of force but in the opposite direction <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">\rm +5.44\times 10^3\ N</span>)</span> according to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law.</p>
    </div>

    <li>If the second rail car has a mass of 2000 kg and was initially at rest, what would its velocity be immediately after the collision?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Because it was initially at rest, its final momentum would equal the impulse (momentum gained) which is the opposite of the impulse experienced by the first car:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_f = \rm +6805\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_f = \frac{\vec{\bf p}_f}{m} = \rm \frac{+6805\ kg\cdot m/s}{2000\ kg} = +3.470\ m/s</p>
    </div>
</ol></li>

<li>Use the concepts of momentum and impulse to explain why an air bag reduces the likelihood of severe injury during an automobile collision.</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Since the passenger eventually comes to rest, his or her final momentum is zero and the impulse is:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_f - \vec{\bf p}_i = 0 - \vec{\bf p}_i = -\vec{\bf p}_i</p>
    <p>Solve for the force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf F}\Delta t</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \frac{\Delta\vec{\bf p}}{\Delta t} = \frac{-\vec{\bf p}_i}{\Delta t}</p>
    <p>The airbag slows the passenger over a longer time (compared to the sudden impact of the windshield) and therefore reduces the force, making severe injury less likely.</p>

<section id="pCons" class="Slide"><h3>Momentum Conservation</h3>
<p>We saw in the previous lesson that <em class="Defn">impulse</em> is a <em>transfer of momentum</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Due to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, the change in one object’s momentum will always be balanced by an equal and opposite change to the other object.</li>
	<li>The total momentum will always be conserved!
        <p class="TeX">\Sigma{\vec{\bf p}_f} = \Sigma{\vec{\bf p}_i}</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p class="Present TeX">\Sigma{\vec{\bf p}_f} = \Sigma{\vec{\bf p}_i}</p>
<p>Momentum conservation is most useful for <em>isolated systems</em> and systems where <em>external forces</em> are balanced.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frictionless collisions, rocket propulsion, and explosions are some of the most common uses for momentum conservation.</li>
	<li>Forces that objects within the system exert on each other are <em class="Defn">internal</em> forces. Internal forces do not change the total momentum of the system.</li>
	<li>Forces that an object within the system experiences due to the environment (e.g. Earth) are <em class="Defn">external</em> forces.</li>
	<li>Unbalanced external forces will transfer momentum into or out of the system (e.g. to or from the Earth!)</li>
	<li>Always draw a free body diagram when there is more than one force involved.</li>

    <li>As a book slides across the floor, it loses both momentum and kinetic energy. What causes these losses? Where does the lost momentum and the lost kinetic energy go?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The friction force causes the changes in energy and momentum. The book’s kinetic energy is transformed into sound and thermal energy, while the momentum is transferred to the Earth.</p>
    
    <li>As a ball falls, it gains kinetic energy and loses momentum (i.e. it gains momentum in the negative direction). What causes these changes? Where does the lost momentum go? Where did the kinetic energy come from?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The gravity force causes the changes in energy and momentum. The ball gains kinetic energy as it loses gravitational potential energy. The ball’s change in momentum is balanced by an opposite impulse experienced by the Earth.</p>

<li>A 1160 kg car moving at 60.0 km/h collides with a 1480 kg car at rest. If the collision brings the first car to a stop, with what velocity will the second car be pushed forward? What assumptions are you making in solving this problem?</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>We are assuming that the system’s momentum remains constant, which will only be true if friction and air resistance are absent, and the collision occurs on flat ground so the gravity and normal forces balance.</p>
    <p>Calculate the momentum of the system before the collision. This is just the momentum of car “A” since car “B” is at rest. Remember to change km/h to m/s:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = m_A\vec{\bf v}_{iA} = \rm 1160\ kg\cdot (+16.7\ m/s) = +19333\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
    <p>After the collision, car “A” is at rest, so all of the momentum is transferred to car “B”.</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = m_B\vec{\bf v}_{fB}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{fB} = \frac{\Sigma\vec{\bf p}}{m_B} = \rm \frac{+19333\ kg\cdot m/s}{1480\ kg} = +13.1\ m/s = +47.0\ km/h</p>

<li>An asteroid with a mass of 8.92 × 10<sup>8</sup> kg moving at 8.50 km/s collides head-on with a second asteroid of mass 3.15 × 10<sup>8</sup> kg with a speed of 9.26 km/s in the opposite direction.
<ol type="a">
    <li>If the two asteroids become stuck together in the collision, what will their final velocity be? Remember that velocity is a vector so you must include a direction!</li>
    <div class="Answer">

<li>A 560 kg roller coaster starts at rest from a height of 10.0 m above the ground and then accelerates down a hill to a final height of 2.50 m above the ground. Assume there is no friction or air resistance.
<ol type="a">
    <li>As the roller coaster moves, is its mechanical energy conserved? Is its momentum conserved? Explain.</li>
    <p class="Answer">The unbalanced force causing the acceleration is the sum of the gravity and normal forces. Since these are external forces that act between the system (roller coaster) and its environment (Earth), there is a transfer of momentum between the system and the Earth; thus the momentum of the system is not conserved. Mechanical energy is conserved because gravity transforms energy between kinetic and potential forms (without affecting the total mechanical energy) while the normal force does not transform any energy since it acts in a direction perpendicular to the motion.</p>

    <li>Determine the final speed of the roller coaster. Use your answer to (a) to decide whether to use energy conservation or momentum conservation.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Calculate the initial energy of the system:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Sigma E_i = E_{gi} = mgh_i = \rm 560\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 10.0\ m = 54936\ J</p>
        <p>Calculate the final gravitational potential energy of the system:</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_{gf} = mgh_f = \rm 560\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 2.50\ m = 13734\ J</p>
        <p>Use energy conservation to find the final kinetic energy:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Sigma E_f = E_{gf} + E_{kf}</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \Sigma E_f - E_{gf} = \rm (54936 - 13734)\ J = 41202\ J</p>
        <p>No use the kinetic energy to calculate the speed. The algebra is the same as for previous questions:</p>
        <p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{kf}}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 41202\ J}{560\ kg}} = 12.1\ m/s</p>

<li>During a roller derby event two teammates, Randy and Sandy, are initially moving together with a velocity of +7.50 m/s. Randy, who has a mass of 60.0 kg, gives 48.0-kilogram Sandy a push in the positive direction causing Sandy to speed up.
    According to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, Randy will experience a negative force and will slow down. If Randy’s final velocity is +3.80 m/s, what will Sandy’s final velocity be?</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Calculate the initial momentum of the system:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = (m_R+m_S)\vec{\bf v}_i = \rm (60.0 + 48.0)\ kg\cdot (+7.50\ m/s) = +810\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
    <p>Randy’s final momentum is:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_{fR} = m_R\vec{\bf v}_{fR} = \rm 60.0\ kg\cdot (+3.80\ m/s) = +228\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
    <p>Because total momentum is conserved, Sandy’s final momentum is:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_{fS} = \Sigma\vec{\bf p} - \vec{\bf p}_{fR} = \rm (+810 - (+228))\ kg\cdot m/s = +582\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
    <p>We can use this momentum to calculate Sandy’s velocity:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{fS} = \frac{\vec{\bf p}_{fS}}{m_S} = \rm {\frac{+582\ kg\cdot m/s}{48.0\ kg}} = \rm {+12.1\ m/s}</p>
