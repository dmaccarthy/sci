<section id="pCons" class="Slide"><h3>Momentum Conservation</h3>
<p>We saw in the previous lesson that <em class="Defn">impulse</em> is a <em>transfer of momentum</em>.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li>Due to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, the change in one object’s momentum will always be balanced by an equal and opposite change to the other object.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The total momentum will always be conserved!

<p>Momentum conservation is most useful for <em>isolated systems</em> and systems where <em>external forces</em> are balanced.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li>Frictionless collisions, rocket propulsion, and explosions are some of the most common uses for momentum conservation.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">Forces that objects within the system exert on each other are <em class="Defn">internal</em> forces. Internal forces do not change the total momentum of the system.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">Forces that an object within the system experiences due to the environment (e.g. Earth) are <em class="Defn">external</em> forces.</li>

    <li>A 1160 kg car moving at 60.0 km/h collides with a 1480 kg car at rest. If the collision brings the first car to a stop, with what velocity will the second car be pushed forward? What assumptions are you making in solving this problem?</li>
    <div class="Answer"></div>
    <!--
To use Conservation of Momentum, we are assuming there are no unbalanced external forces: there is no air resistance or friction (neither driver is trying to brake or accelerate), no applied force, and the gravity and normal forces are perfectly balanced (i.e. the ground is level).
Evaluate the total initial momentum…
Σpi = pAi + pBi
= mAvAi + mBvBi
= 1160 kg (+16.7 m/s) + 1480 kg (0.00 m/s)
= +1.93 × 104 N·s
The total final momentum is…
Σpf = pAf + pBf
= mAvAf + mBvBf
Since vAf = 0.00 m/s…
Σpf = mBvBf
vBf = Σpf / mB
= +1.93 × 104 N·s / (1480 kg)
= +13.1 m/s = +47.0 km/h

    <!--
a) 
The total momentum is…
Σp = pAi + pBi
= mAvAi + mBvBi
= 8.92 × 108 kg (+8.50 × 103 m/s) + 3.15 × 108 kg (–9.26 × 103 m/s)
= +4.67 × 1012 N·s
Since momentum is conserved, we can equate the initial and final momenta. Note that the final velocities are the same since the asteroids stick together…
Σp = mAvf + mBvf
Σp = (mA + mB) vf
vf = Σp / (mA + mB) 
= +4.67 × 1012 N·s / (8.92 × 108 kg + 3.15 × 108 kg)
= +3.87 × 103 m/s

b) 
ΔpA = mAΔvA
= 8.92 × 108 kg (+3.87 × 103 m/s – 8.50 × 103 m/s)
= –4.13 × 1012 N·s
By Newton’s 3rd Law, the impulse experienced by mass “B” is +4.13 × 1012 N·s

c) 
ΔpA = FA Δt
FA = ΔpA / Δt = –4.13 × 1012 N·s / (0.250 s) = –1.65  × 1013 N
FB = –FA = +1.65  × 1013 N

d) 
Evaluate the initial mechanical energy…
ΣEi = ½ mAvAi2 + ½ mBvABi2
= ½ (8.92 × 108 kg) (8.50 × 103 m/s)2 + ½ (3.15 × 108 kg) (9.26 × 103 m/s)2
= 4.57 × 1016 J
Evaluate the final mechanical energy…
ΣEf = ½ mAvAf2 + ½ mBvABf2
= ½ (8.92 × 108 kg) (3.87 × 103 m/s)2 + ½ (3.15 × 108 kg) (3.87 × 103 m/s)2
= 9.02 × 1015 J
Calculate the change in mechanical energy…
ΔE = ΣEf – ΣEi
= 9.02 × 1015 J – 4.57 × 1016 J
= –3.67 × 1016 J
Express the change as a percentage…
ΔE / Ei × 100%
= –3.67 × 1016 J / (4.57 × 1016 J) × 100%
= –80.3%

    <li>A 560 kg roller coaster starts at rest from a height of 10.0 m above the ground and then accelerates down a hill to a final height of 2.50 m above the ground. Assume there is no friction or air resistance.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>As the roller coaster moves, is its mechanical energy conserved? Is its momentum conserved? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The unbalanced force causing the acceleration is the sum of the gravity and normal forces. Since these are external forces that act between the system (roller coaster) and its environment (Earth), there is a transfer of momentum between the system and the Earth; thus the momentum of the system is not conserved. Mechanical energy is conserved because gravity transforms energy between kinetic and potential forms (without affecting the total mechanical energy) while the normal force does not transform any energy since it acts in a direction perpendicular to the motion.</div>
    
        <li>Determine the final speed of the roller coaster. Use your answer to (a) to decide whether to use energy conservation or momentum conservation.</li>

Isolate the final speed…

vf = √[2g(hi – hf)]

    <li>As a ball falls, it gains kinetic energy and loses momentum (i.e. it gains momentum in the negative direction). What causes these changes? Where does the lost momentum go? Where did the kinetic energy come from?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The gravity force causes the changes in energy and momentum. The ball gains kinetic energy as it loses gravitational potential energy. The ball’s change in momentum is balanced by an opposite impulse experienced by the Earth.</div>

        <li>A moving train collides with a stationary rail car and they couple together (the car attaches to the other cars of the train). Discuss all energy and momentum transfers / transformations.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The two cars exert equal and opposite forces on each other for the same amount of time. Since <span class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf F}\Delta t</span>, the momentum gained by one car is balanced by the momentum lost by the other car.
            Since the cars are moving at different velocities, they do not undergo the same displacement while the force is acting, thus the amounts of work done on the cars, <span class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \vec{\bf F}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</span>, are not equal and opposite. Mechanical energy is not conserved since some of this energy is transformed into sound and thermal energy.</div>

        <li>When attempting to numerically solve a collision problem such as this, would it be more appropriate to use the law of momentum conservation or the law of energy conservation? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Based on the above discussion, energy conservation cannot be used to solve the collision when the amount of sound and thermal energy produced is unknown. Therefore, it is usually appropriate to use conservation of momentum for collision problems.</div>

    <!--
a) 
The total momentum is…
Σp = pAi + pBi
= mAvAi + mBvBi
= 2500 kg (+5.56 m/s) + 3000 kg (0.00 m/s)
= +1.39 × 104 N·s
Since momentum is conserved, we can equate the initial and final momenta. Note that the final velocities are the same since the rail cars stick together…
Σp = mAvf + mBvf
Σp = (mA + mB) vf
vf = Σp / (mA + mB) 
= +1.39 × 104 N·s / (2500 kg + 3000 kg)
= +2.53 m/s = +9.09 km/h

b) 
Evaluate the initial mechanical energy…
ΣEi = ½ mAvAi2 + ½ mBvABi2
= ½ (2500 kg) (5.56 m/s)2 + ½ (3000 kg) (0.00 m/s)2
= 3.86 × 104 J
Evaluate the final mechanical energy…
ΣEf = ½ mAvAf2 + ½ mBvABf2
= ½ (2500 kg) (2.53 m/s)2 + ½ (3000 kg) (2.53 m/s)2
= 1.75 × 104 J
Calculate the change in mechanical energy…
ΔE = ΣEf – ΣEi
= 1.75 × 104 J – 3.86 × 104 J
= –2.10 × 104 J

c) 
ΔpB = mBΔvB
= 3000 kg (+2.53 m/s – 0.00 m/s)
= +7.58 × 103 N·s
ΔpA = –ΔpB = –7.58 × 103 N·s
You would get the same answer by calculating…
ΔpA = mAΔvA = 2500 kg (+2.53 m/s – 5.56 m/s)

d) 
FA = ΔpA / Δt = –7.58 × 103 N·s / (0.600 s) = –1.26  × 104 N
FB = –FA = +1.26  × 104 N
