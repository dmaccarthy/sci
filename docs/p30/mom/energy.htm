    <p>Use the elastic potential energy equation. Remember to change cm to metres...</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{elas} = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta L)^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2}(85.0\ N/m)(0.0700\ m)^2 = 0.208\ J</p>

    <li>Students release a 200 g ball from the top of a 25.0 m tall building. The ball is dropped from rest. Neglecting air resistance, determine the speed with which the ball will strike the ground.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The mechanical energy is gravitational potential initially. Remember to change grams to kg...</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \rm 0.200\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 25.0\ m = 49.1\ J</p>
        <p>When the ball reaches the ground, the gravitational potential energy is zero, so all of the mechanical energy has become kinetic. Algebra is the same as #3b of the “Remember?” section...</p>
    <p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 49.1\ J}{0.200\ kg}} = 22.1\ m/s</p>

    <li>Would your answers for (a) and (b) change if the students used a ball with a different mass? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>No! Since gravitational potential energy is transformed (partly) into kinetic energy, we can write energy conservation as...</p>
        <p class="TeX">mgh_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh_f</p>

        <p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{2g(h_i - h_f)}</p>

    </div>

    <li>Would your answers change if the effects of air resistance were included? Explain.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Yes! Air resistance transforms some of the mechanical energy into waste (sound and/or thermal energy). This means that the final kinetic energy would be less than calculated above and the ball would have a slower speed.</div>

    <div class="Answer">
        <p>At the bottom of the incline, there is only kinetic energy...</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2} (12.5\ kg) (2.50\ m/s)^2 = 39.1\ J</p>

        <p class="TeX">mgh_f - \vec{\bf F_f}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d} = E_i</p>
        <p>Because the height (opposite side) and displacement (hypotenuse) are related by trigonometry, we can sbstitute...</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \frac{h_f}{\sin 10.0^\circ}</p>
        <p>...to get...</p>
        <p class="TeX">mgh_f - \vec{\bf F_f}\cdot \frac{h_f}{\sin 10.0^\circ} = E_i</p>
        <p class="TeX">h_f \left(mg - \frac{\vec{\bf F_f}}{\sin 10.0^\circ}\right) = E_i</p>
        <p class="TeX">h_f = \frac{E_i}{mg - \frac{\vec{\bf F_f}}{\sin 10.0^\circ}}</p>
        <p class="TeX">h_f = \rm \frac{39.1\ J}{12.5\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 - \frac{-5.00\ N}{\sin 10.0^\circ}} = 0.258\ m</p>
        <p>Note that the force of friction is negative because it acts in the opposite direction to the displacement. If you use a positive friction force the final height would be greater than it was with no friction, which would violate energy conservation.</p>
        <p>We can check our answer by calculating...</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_{pf} = mgh_f = \rm 12.5\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.258\ m = 31.6\ J</p>

        <p>We can verify that the work done by friction is equal to change in energy. Note that there may be a small error if you use the answers rounded to three significant digits.</p>

    <li>One student claimed that since a standard rope doesn’t stretch (much), its “spring constant” <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">k</span>)</span> is equal to (practically) zero. Another student disagreed, saying that if the rope doesn’t stretch, its spring constant is (practically) infinite! Which student is correct? Justify your answer.</li>
    <div class="Answer">

        <p>Since <span class="TeX">x</span> will be “small” no matter how much work is done in stretching the rope (at least up to the point where the rope breaks!),
            the value of <span class="TeX">k</span> must be very big; the closer <span class="TeX">x</span> gets to zero, the closer <span class="TeX">k</span> gets to infinity!</p>

    <li>Why is an elastic cord used for “bungee jumping” rather than a regular rope? Justify your answer by referring to the work-energy theorem.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The work-energy theorem energy states that...</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \vec{\bf F}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</p>
        <p>This means the force is...</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \frac{\Delta E_k}{\Delta\vec{\bf d}}</p>
        <p>Less force is exerted when the work is done over a larger displacement. Since a standard rope stretches through a very small displacement, the force would be very large and would likely cause injuries. A bungee extends the work over a much larger displacement, resulting in a much smaller force.</p>
