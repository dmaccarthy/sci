<section id="c" class="Slide"><h3>Elastic &amp; Inelatic Collisions</h3>
    <p>When a system experiences no unbalanced, <em>external</em> forces, the system’s total momentum must remain constant.</p>
    <p data-cue="+"><em>Internal</em> forces do not affect the total momentum; however, they can still transform kinetic energy to or from other forms...</p>
    <p data-cue="+">A system’s kinetic energy will not necessarily remain constant during a collision or other situations where the momentum does!</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Whether the kinetic energy changes, and by how much, depends on the nature of the forces.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">A collision in which the kinetic energy remains constant is called an <em class="Defn">elastic collision</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>When two sponge or rubber objects collide, their kinetic energy is temporarily transformed into elastic potential energy as the objects compress.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The kinetic energy is restored when the objects return to their original shapes.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Almost no sound or thermal energy is produced; kinetic energy is (nearly) conserved.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Although we use the term “elastic”, other types of force can also result in collisions with no change of kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">A collision in which there is a loss of kinetic energy is called an <em class="Defn">inelastic collision</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>When two colliding objects stick together after the collision, the collision will <em>always</em> be inelastic.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">In fact, this type of collision results in a <em>maximum</em> loss of kinetic energy (more is lost when they stick together than when they don’t.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">A scenario when kinetic energy increase is sometimes called <em class="Defn">superelastic</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>This is only possible in explosions, and other situations where there is a source of energy (e.g. chemical) available to increase the kinetic energy.</li>

    <li>Physicists use a particle accelerator to produce a 1D collision between a proton <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">m_p</span></span> = 1.67 × 10<sup>–27</sup> <span class="NoWrap">kg)</span> initially at rest and a particle of unknown mass moving at +6.00 × 10<sup>7</sup> m/s.

<!--	
a) 
Equations:
p = mv	[Momentum]
Σpi = Σpf	[Conservation of Momentum]
Variables:
mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg
vpi = 0.00 m/s
vpf = +9.59 × 107 m/s
vui = +6.00 × 107 m/s
vuf = +3.59 × 107 m/s
Solution:
Without knowing the mass of one of the particles, we cannot calculate the total momentum. Instead, we can equate the equation for the total momentum before the collision to the equation for the total momentum after the collision…
Σpi = Σpf
mpvpi + muvui = mpvpf + muvuf
The first term is zero since the proton is initially at rest...
muvui = mpvpf + muvuf
Solve for mu by first “collecting like terms” so both appearances of mu are on the same side of the equation…
muvui – muvuf = mpvpf
mu (vui – vuf) = mpvpf
mu = mpvpf / (vui – vuf)
= 1.67 × 10–27 kg (+9.59 × 107 m/s) / (+6.00 × 107 m/s – 3.59 × 107 m/s)
= 6.65 × 10–27 kg

b) 
Equations:
Ek = ½ mv2	[Kinetic Energy]
Variables:
mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg
vpi = 0.00 m/s
vpf = +9.59 × 107 m/s
mu = 6.65 × 10–27 kg
vui = +6.00 × 107 m/s
vuf = +3.59 × 107 m/s
Solution:
Evaluate the initial mechanical energy (combined kinetic energy of the two particles)…
Ei = ½ mPvPi2 + ½ mUvUi2
= 0 J + ½ (6.65 × 10–27 kg) (6.00 × 107 m/s)2
= 1.20 × 10–11 J
Evaluate the final mechanical energy…
Ef = ½ mPvPf2 + ½ mUvUf2
= ½ (1.67 × 10–27 kg) (9.59 × 107 m/s)2 + ½ (6.65 × 10–27 kg) (3.59 × 107 m/s)2
= 1.20 × 10–11 J
The collision appears to be elastic because the mechanical energy does not change.

a) 
Equations:
p = mv	[Momentum]
Σpi = Σpf	[Conservation of Momentum]
Variables:
mA = 0.350 kg
vAi = +2.25 m/s
vAf = +0.900 m/s
mB = 0.300 kg
vBi = –0.400 m/s
Solution:
Calculate the total momentum of the system before the collision…
Σp = mAvAi + mBvBi = 0.350 kg · (+2.25 m/s) + 0.300 kg · (–0.400 m/s) = +0.668 N·s
After the collision, the total momentum remains the same…
Σp = mAvAf + mBvBf
Σp – mAvAf = mBvBf
vBf = (Σp – mAvAf) / mB
= (+0.668 N·s – 0.350 kg · (+0.900 m/s)) / (0.300 kg)
= +1.18 m/s

b) 
Equations:
Ek = ½ mv2	[Kinetic Energy]
Variables:
mA = 0.350 kg
vAi = +2.25 m/s
vAf = +0.900 m/s
mB = 0.300 kg
vBi = –0.400 m/s
vBf = +1.18 /s
Solution:
Evaluate the initial mechanical energy…
Ei = ½ mAvAi2 + ½ mBvBi2
= ½ (0.350 kg) (2.25 m/s)2 + ½ (0.300 kg) (0.400 m/s)2
= 0.910 J
Evaluate the final mechanical energy…
Ef = ½ mAvAf2 + ½ mBvBf2
= ½ (0.350 kg) (0.900 m/s)2 + ½ (0.300 kg) (1.18 m/s)2
= 0.351 J
This is an inelastic collision since there is a 61.4% loss of mechanical energy.

    <li>A toy train set includes a locomotive of mass of 750 grams and a passenger car of mass 400 grams. The locomotive has an initial velocity of –20.0 cm/s as it backs into the passenger car which is initially at rest. The locomotive and the passenger car do not join together successfully, and the passenger car moves off with a final velocity of –15.0 cm/s. Calculate:<ol type="a">
        <li>the final velocity of the locomotive.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Because the passenger car is at rest, the locomotive’s initial momentum is the total system momentum:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_{iL} = m_L\vec{\bf p}_{iL} = \rm 0.750\ kg\cdot (-0.200\ m/s) = -0.150\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
            <p>Now calculate the momentum of the passenger car after the collision:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_{fP} = m_P\vec{\bf p}_{fP} = \rm 0.400\ kg\cdot (-0.150\ m/s) = -0.0600\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
            <p>The total momentum remains constant, so the final momentum of the locomotive is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_{fL} = \Sigma\vec{\bf p} - \vec{\bf p}_{fP} = \rm (-0.150 - (-0.060))\ kg\cdot m/s = -0.090\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
            <p>Finally, calculate the locomotive’s final velocity:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{fL} = \frac{\vec{\bf p}_{fL}}{m_L} = \rm \frac{-0.090\ kg\cdot m/s}{0.750\ kg} = -0.120\ m/s</p>
        </div>
        <li>the change in mechanical energy of the system.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Since the passenger car is initially at rest, the initial mechanical energy of the system is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Sigma E_i = \frac{1}{2}m_L v_{iL}^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2} (0.750\ kg) (0.200\ m/s)^2 = 0.0150\ J</p>
            <p>The final mechanical energy is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\begin{align}\Sigma E_f &= \frac{1}{2}m_L v_{fL}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_P v_{fP}^2
                \\[12pt] &= \rm {\frac{1}{2} (0.750\ kg) (0.120\ m/s)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (0.400\ kg) (0.150\ m/s)^2}
                \\[12pt] &= \rm {0.00990\ J}
            \end{align}</p>
            <p>The change in energy is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Delta E = \Sigma E_f - \Sigma E_i = \rm (0.00990 - 0.0150)\ J = -0.0051\ J</p>
