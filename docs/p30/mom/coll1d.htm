<section id="c" class="Slide"><h3>Elastic &amp; Inelatic Collisions</h3>
    <p>When a system experiences no unbalanced, <em>external</em> forces, the system’s total momentum must remain constant.</p>
    <p data-cue="+"><em>Internal</em> forces do not affect the total momentum; however, they can still transform kinetic energy to or from other forms...</p>
    <p data-cue="+">A system’s kinetic energy will not necessarily remain constant during a collision or other situations where the momentum does!</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Whether the kinetic energy changes, and by how much, depends on the nature of the forces.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">A collision in which the kinetic energy remains constant is called an <em class="Defn">elastic collision</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>When two sponge or rubber objects collide, their kinetic energy is temporarily transformed into elastic potential energy as the objects compress.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The kinetic energy is restored when the objects return to their original shapes.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Almost no sound or thermal energy is produced; kinetic energy is (nearly) conserved.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Although we use the term “elastic”, other types of force can also result in collisions with no change of kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">A collision in which there is a loss of kinetic energy is called an <em class="Defn">inelastic collision</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>When two colliding objects stick together after the collision, the collision will <em>always</em> be inelastic.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">In fact, this type of collision results in a <em>maximum</em> loss of kinetic energy (more is lost when they stick together than when they don’t.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">A scenario when kinetic energy increase is sometimes called <em class="Defn">superelastic</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>This is only possible in explosions, and other situations where there is a source of energy (e.g. chemical) available to increase the kinetic energy.</li>

    <li>Physicists use a particle accelerator to produce a 1D collision between a proton <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">m_p</span></span> = 1.67 × 10<sup>–27</sup> <span class="NoWrap">kg)</span> initially at rest and a particle of unknown mass moving at +6.00 × 10<sup>7</sup> m/s. As a result of the collision, the unknown particle is slowed to a velocity of +3.59 × 10<sup>7</sup> m/s while the proton is accelerated to a velocity of +9.59 × 10<sup>7</sup> m/s.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>What is the mass of the unknown particle?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Since the proton is initially at rest, the total momentum is equal to the momentum of the unknown particle before the collision:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_{iU} = m_U\vec{\bf v}_{iU}</p>
            <p>After collision, both particles are in motion:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_{fP} + \vec{\bf p}_{fU} = m_P\vec{\bf v}_{fP} + m_U\vec{\bf v}_{fU}</p>
            <p>Without knowing the mass of the unkonwn particle we cannot calculate the momentum, but we can equate the initial and final momentum becuase momentum is conserved:</p>
            <p class="TeX">m_U\vec{\bf v}_{iU} = m_P\vec{\bf v}_{fP} + m_U\vec{\bf v}_{fU}</p>
            <p>We can now re-arrange to find the mass of the unknown particle:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\begin{align}
                m_U\vec{\bf v}_{iU} - m_U\vec{\bf v}_{fU} &= m_P\vec{\bf v}_{fP}
                \\[10pt] m_U \left(\vec{\bf v}_{iU} - \vec{\bf v}_{fU} \right) &= m_P\vec{\bf v}_{fP}
                \\[10pt] m_U &= \frac{m_P\vec{\bf v}_{fP}}{\vec{\bf v}_{iU} - \vec{\bf v}_{fU}}

                \\[10pt] &= \rm {6.65\times 10^{-27}\ kg}
            \end{align}</p>
        </div>
    
        <li>Calculate the change (if any) in mechanical energy and classify the collision as elastic, inelastic, or superelastic.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Calculate the initial mechanical energy:</p>

    <li>In a game of billiards, a 350-gram ball moving with a velocity of +2.25 m/s collides with a 300-gram ball moving in the exact opposite direction with a velocity of –0.400 m/s. After the collision, the heavier ball’s velocity is +0.900 m/s.

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">elastic</em> and <em class="Defn">inelastic</em> collisions.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Elastic means that mechanical energy as well as momentum is conserved. Inelastic means that only momentum is conserved as some of the mechanical energy is transformed into non-mechanical forms such as sound or thermal energy.</div>

    <li>What does it mean to say that a collision in which the objects remain attached after the collison is “completely” inelastic.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The loss of mechanical energy is greatest (while momentum is conserved) when the two masses stick together.</div>

    <li>A toy train set includes a locomotive of mass of 750 grams and a passenger car of mass 400 grams. The locomotive has an initial velocity of –20.0 cm/s as it backs into the passenger car which is initially at rest. The locomotive and the passenger car do not join together successfully, and the passenger car moves off with a final velocity of –15.0 cm/s. Calculate:<ol type="a">
        <li>the final velocity of the locomotive.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Because the passenger car is at rest, the locomotive’s initial momentum is the total system momentum:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\Sigma\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf p}_{iL} = m_L\vec{\bf p}_{iL} = \rm 0.750\ kg\cdot (-0.200\ m/s) = -0.150\ kg\cdot m/s</p>
            <p>Now calculate the momentum of the passenger car after the collision:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}_{fP} = m_P\vec{\bf p}_{fP} = \rm 0.400\ kg\cdot (-0.150\ m/s) = -0.0600\ kg\cdot m/s</p>

        </div>
        <li>the change in mechanical energy of the system.</li>
        <div class="Answer">

        <li>Classify the collisions as elastic, partly or completely inelastic, or superelastic.</li>
