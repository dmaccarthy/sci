    <li>A moving train collides with a stationary rail car and they couple together (the car attaches to the other cars of the train). Discuss all energy and momentum transfers / transformations.</li>
    <p class="Answer">The two cars exert equal and opposite forces on each other for the same amount of time. Since <span class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = \vec{\bf F}\Delta t</span>, the momentum gained by one car is balanced by the momentum lost by the other car. Since the cars are moving at different velocities, they do not undergo the same displacement while the force is acting, thus the amounts of work done on the cars, <span class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \vec{\bf F}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</span>, are not equal and opposite. Mechanical energy is not conserved since some of this energy is transformed into sound and thermal energy.</p>

    <li>When attempting to numerically solve a collision problem such as this, would it be more appropriate to use the law of momentum conservation or the law of energy conservation? Explain.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Based on the above discussion, energy conservation cannot be used to solve the collision when the amount of sound and thermal energy produced is unknown. Therefore, it is usually appropriate to use conservation of momentum for collision problems.</p>

<li>A 2500 kg rail car moving at +20.0 km/h collides with a stationary 3000 kg rail car. The collision causes the cars to couple together.
