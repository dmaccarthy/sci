    <p><em class="Defn">Momentum</em> (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}</span>) is the vector analog of kinetic energy:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf p}=m\vec{\bf v}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Like <span class="TeX">E_k</span>, momentum measures “quantity of motion”, but while energy is a scalar, momentum includes a direction.</li>
        <li>Like energy, momentum is a <em class="Defn">conserved</em> quantity.</li>
        <li>Unlike energy, momentum does <b>not</b> come in different forms!</li>
        <li>Momentum is measured in <span class="TeX">\rm{kg\cdot m/s}</span> or <span class="TeX">\rm{N\cdot s}</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <em>change</em> in an object’s momentum is called <em class="Defn">impulse</em>.<p>
    <ul>
        <li>According to <em class="Defn">Newton’s 2nd Law</em>, <em>forces</em> cause an object to experience a change in momentum:
            <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf p} = m\Delta\vec{\bf v} = \vec{\bf F} \Delta t</p></li>
        <li>If the force is not constant, you can calculate impulse as the area under a graph of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}</span> vs. <span class="NoWrap"><span class="TeX">t</span>.</span></li>
        <li>According to <em class="Defn">Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</em>, the impulse that two interacting objects exert on each other will be equal and opposite.</li>
        <li>The <em>total</em> momentum of a system will be constant, as long as there are no <em>unbalanced</em>, <em>external</em> forces.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Momentum conservation is typically used to solve <em class="Defn">collisions</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Often, a system loses mechanical energy in the form of sound or thermal energy as a result of a collision.</li>
        <li>Collisions in which there is a loss of mechanical energy are classified as <em class="Defn">inelastic</em>.</li>
        <li>Collisions in which the mechanical energy remains constant are classified as <em class="Defn">elastic</em>.</li>
        <li>When two colliding objects stick together, the collision will be <em>completely</em> inelastic (maximum loss of mechanical energy).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Collisions involving motion in both the <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-directions are called <em class="Defn">2D collsions</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Draw a (tip-to-tail) <em class="Defn">vector diagram</em> to add momentums; do not just add the magnitudes!</li>
        <li>The total <em>initial</em> momentum (resultant vector) must be the same as the total <em>final</em> momentum.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, you can use <em class="Defn">trigonometry</em> to find missing angles or magnitudes on your vector diagram.</li>
        <li>The Pythagoras and “SOH CAH TOA” equations only apply to triangles containing a right angle.</li>
        <li>For triangles that may not contain a right angle, you can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can resolve each momentum vector into <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-<em class="Defn">components</em>, and then solve the <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-equations independently; the total <span class="TeX">x</span>-momentum and the total <span class="TeX">y</span>-momentum must <em>both</em> be conserved!</li>
    </ul>
