<section class="Slide"><h3>2D Vectors</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Vectors</em> are quantities that involve a direction, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can illustrate vectors using a <em class="Defn">vector diagram</em>, in which each vector is drawn as an arrow illustrating the direction and the magnitude (size) of the vector.</li>
    <li>A vector described by its magnitude and direction is said to be in <em class="Defn">polar form</em>:<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \rm{8.0\ N\ [30°]}</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/mom/img/vec2d.js#F" class="s20"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>Directions are measured as angles measured counterclockwise from the <span class="TeX">+x</span>-axis.</li>
    <li>Negative angles indicate clockwise from the <span class="TeX">+x</span>-axis.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">components</em> of a vector describe “how much” of the vector is in each of the <span class="TeX">x</span> and <span class="TeX">y</span> directions.</li>
    <li>We can use trigonometry to calculate the components of a vector from its magnitude and direction:
        <p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_x=\left|\vec{\bf{F}}\right|\cos{\theta}</p>
        <p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_y=\left|\vec{\bf{F}}\right|\sin{\theta}</p></li>
    <li>Describing a vector by its components is called the <em class="Defn">Cartesian</em> form of the vector:<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \rm{(6.9, 4.0)\ N}</p></li>
    <li>We can also use trigonometry to convert a vector from Cartesian to polar form:
        <p class="TeX">\left|\vec{\bf{F}}\right|=\sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}</p>
        <p class="TeX">\tan{\theta}=\frac{{\vec{\bf{F}}}_y}{{\vec{\bf{F}}}_x}</p></li>
    <li>When solving for <span class="TeX">\theta</span> using <span class="TeX">\tan^{-1}</span>, you will get only one of two possible solutions; when the <span class="TeX">x</span>-component is negative, you will have to add 180° to get the correct answer.</li>
    <li>Compass directions should be converted to conventional angles...</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Vector Diagrams</h3>
<p>We can illustrate <em class="Defn">addition</em> of two or more 2D vectors by drawing a <em>tip-to-tail</em> <em class="Defn">vector diagram</em>.</p>
<ul class="Blue"><li>Example: A speedboat has a velocity of 20.0 m/s [120°] relative to the water. There is a current of 5.00 m/s [200°]. Determine the resultant velocity.</li></ul>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/mom/img/vec2d.js#boat" class="s16"></svg></p>
<ul><li>To <em class="Defn">subtract</em> a vector, just add its negative!</li></ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Vector Arithmetic</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Center _Present"><svg data-svg2="p30/mom/img/vec2d.js#boat" class="s16"></svg></p>
<p>To add or subtract vectors more precisely than is possible with a diagram, convert all vectors to Cartesian form...</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{1x} = |\vec{\bf v}_1| \cos\theta_1 = \rm{20.0\ m/s\cdot\cos 120° = -10.0\ m/s}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{1y} = |\vec{\bf v}_1| \sin\theta_1 = \rm{20.0\ m/s\cdot\sin 120° = +17.3\ m/s}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{2x} = |\vec{\bf v}_2| \cos\theta_2 = \rm{5.00\ m/s\cdot\cos 200° = -4.70\ m/s}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_{2y} = |\vec{\bf v}_2| \sin\theta_2 = \rm{5.00\ m/s\cdot\sin 200° = -1.71\ m/s}</p>
<p>Then perform the calculations separately on the <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-components...</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_x = \vec{\bf v}_{1x} + \vec{\bf v}_{2x}= \rm{(-10.0 + (-4.70))\ m/s = -14.7\ m/s}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}_y = \vec{\bf v}_{1y} + \vec{\bf v}_{2y}= \rm{(+17.3 + (-1.71))\ m/s = +15.6\ m/s}</p>
<ul><li>If the resultant vector needs to be in polar form, just convert it using the Pythagoras and <span class="TeX">\tan^{-1}</span> formulas.</li></ul>

    <li>Define the <em class="Defn">magnitude</em> of a vector.</li>
    <p class="Answer">The magnitude is the <em>size</em> of the vector without including the direction.</p>

    <li>Explain how to describe the <em class="Defn">direction</em> of a 2D vector.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Directions in 2D are described as angles measured from the positive <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis. Angles measured counter-clockwise are positive and negative angles are measured clockwise.</p>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">polar</em> and <em class="Defn">Cartesian</em> form for 2D vectors and explain how to convert between the two forms.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The <em>polar</em> form describes a 2D vector as a magnitude and direction. For example, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}</span> = <span class="NoWrap">25.0 N [+60.0°]</span> means a force that is 25.0-newtons strong directed 60.0° counter-clockwise from the direction parallel to the positive <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis.</p>
        <p>The <em>Cartesian</em> form decribes the vector as separate <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span> -components. For example, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}</span> = <span class="NoWrap">(+12.5, +21.7) N</span> means a force that pulls with 12.5 newtons parallel to the <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis and simultaneously with 21.7 newtons parallel to the <span class="TeX">y</span>-axis.</p>
        <p>Because any 2D vector and its components form a right-angle triangle, you can use the trigonometry relations</p>

    <li>As an object slides down a ramp, it experiences a force of gravity equal to <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_g</span> = <span class="NoWrap">52.0 N [–90.0º]</span>. Measurements determine that the “contact force” of the ramp pushing on the object (i.e. the normal and friction forces combined) has a magnitude of <span class="TeX">|\vec{\bf F}_{contact}|</span> = 45.0 N and the magnitude of the net (resultant) force is 18.5 N. Determine the direction of the contact force and of the net force. [Hint: You may find the compass from your geometry set useful!]</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Draw a sketch of the vector diagram first. We know that the two forces and the resultant vector form a triangle. We know all three sides of the triangle (52.0, 45.0, and 18.5 N), so we can use the Law of Cosines to find the direction of the contact force:</p>
        <p class="TeX">c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\theta</p>
        <p class="TeX">2ab\cos\theta = a^2 + b^2 - c^2</p>
        <p class="TeX">\cos\theta = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}</p>
        <p class="TeX">\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}\right)</p>
        <p>If <span class="TeX">\theta</span> is the angle between gravity and the contact force, then we must take <span class="TeX">c = \rm 18.5\ N</span> since the resultant force is the side opposite to <span class="TeX">\theta</span>:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{52.0^2 + 45.0^2 - 18.5^2}{2\cdot 52.0\cdot 45.0}\right) = 20.4^\circ</p>
        <p>Since gravity points along the negative <span class="TeX">y</span>-axis, the direction of the contact force from the positive <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis is:</p>
        <p class="TeX">90^\circ - \theta = (90 - 20.4)^\circ = 69.6^\circ</p>
        <p>Now that we know the magnitude and direction of both forces, we can add them using components and then draw the vector diagram accurately!</p>
