    <!--
a) 
Equations:
F = ma	[Newton’s 2nd Law]
a = (vf – vi) / Δt	[Acceleration]
p = mv	[Momentum]
Δp = pf – pi	[Change in Momentum]
Variables: See table.
Solution:
Calculate Abigail’s acceleration and the force exerted on her…
a = Δv / Δt = (2.00 m/s – 5.00 m/s) / 0.500 s = –6.00 m/s2
F = ma = (40.0 kg) (–6.00 m/s2) = –240 N
Now calculate Braden’s acceleration using the fact (Newton’s 3rd Law!) that the force is +240 N…
a = F / m = +240 N / 50.0 kg = +4.80 m/s2
Finally, calculate Braden’s final velocity...
a = (vf – vi)/ Δt
aΔt = vf – vi
vf = aΔt + vi
= (+4.80 m/s2) (0.500 s) + 0.00 m/s
= +2.40 m/s

0.500
a / (m/s2)
–6.00 
 +4.80
F / N
–240 N
+240 N

Next calculate Abigail’s initial and final momenta and the change…
pi = mvi = 40.0 kg · (+5.00 m/s) = +200 N·s
pf = mvf = 40.0 kg · (+2.00 m/s) = +80.0 N·s
Δp = pf – pi = +80.0 N·s – (+200 N·s) = –120 N·s
Next calculate the same for Brandon…
pi = mvi = 50.0 kg · (0.00 m/s) = +0.00 N·s
pf = mvf = 50.0 kg · (+2.40 m/s) = +120 N·s
Δp = pf – pi = +80.0 N·s – (+200 N·s) = –120 N·s

b) 

c) 
Σpi = pAi + pBi = +200 N·s + 0.00 N·s = +200 N·s

Σpf = pAf + pBf = +80.0 N·s + 120 N·s = +200 N·s

    <li>A grocery cart has a mass of 72.5 kg, including groceries. Seeing that there is only one can of coffee left on the shelf, the shopper suddenly speeds up from 0.750 m/s [north] to 1.95 m/s [north]. How much impulse did the shopper impart to the cart?</li>

<!--
a) 
Equations:
p = mv	[Momentum]
Δp = pf – pi	[Impulse]
Ek = ½ mv2	[Kinetic Energy]
Ep = mgh	[Gravitational Potential Energy]
Variables:
m = 1.75 kg
h = 2.25 m
v = 0.00 m/s
Solution:
p = mv
= 1.75 kg (0.00 m/s)
= 0.00 N·s
E = Ek + Ep = ½ mv2 + mgh
= ½ (1.75 kg) (0.00 m/s)2 + (1.75 kg) (9.81 m/s2) (2.25 m)
= 38.6 J

b) 
Variables:
m = 1.75 kg
h = 1.00 m
v = –4.80 m/s
Solution:
p = mv
= 1.75 kg (–4.80 m/s)
= –8.40 N·s
E = Ek + Ep = ½ mv2 + mgh
= ½ (1.75 kg) (4.80 m/s)2 + (1.75 kg) (9.81 m/s2) (1.00 m)
= 37.3 J

c) 
Gravity (and to a slight extent the air resistance) caused the momentum to change; the impulse is
Δp = pf – pi
= –8.40 N·s – 0.00 N·s
= –8.40 N·s
Gravity converted some of the mechanical energy from gravitational potential to kinetic energy. There was a slight decrease in the total mechanical energy due to the air resistance.

    <li>An apple weighing 4.25 newtons falls from a tree, striking the ground in 0.900 seconds. How much impulse did the force of gravity impart to the apple? What was the apple’s velocity when it hit the ground if air resistance can be neglected?</li>
    <div class="Answer"></div>
<!--
Equations:
Fg = mg	[Mass & Weight]
p = mv	[Momentum]
Δp = F Δt = pf – pi	[Impulse]
Variables:
Fg = –4.25 N
Δt = 0.900 s
g = –9.81 m/s2
Solution:
Calculate the impulse…
Δp = Fg Δt
= –4.25 N · 0.900 s
= –3.83 N·s
Calculate the mass…
Fg = mg
m = Fg / g
= –4.25 N / (–9.81 m/s2)
= 0.433 kg
Assuming the apple’s initial velocity and momentum were zero, the final momentum is the same as the impulse.
pf = mvf
vf = pf / m
= –3.83 N·s / (0.433 kg)
= –8.83 m/s

5. 	a) Calculate the area of the triangle for the first 0.08 seconds…
Δp = Base × Height / 2 = 0.08 s × 100 N / 2 = 4.00 N·s
Calculate the area of the rectangle for the next 0.10 seconds…
Δp = Base × Height = 0.10 s × 100 N = 10.0 N·s
Calculate the area of the triangle for the last 0.12 seconds…
Δp = Base × Height / 2 = 0.12 s × 100 N / 2 = 6.00 N·s
The total impulse (area) is (4.00 + 10.0 + 6.00) N·s = 20.0 N·s

    <li>Define <em>impulse</em> and explain how it is related to momentum and force.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Impulse is the <em>change</em> in momentum. A <em>force</em> is what <em>causes</em> the object’s impulse to change:

    <div class="Answer">Because the velocity is constant, the net force must be zero according to Newton’s Laws: i.e. the applied force is balanced by gravity. Although the work and impulse equations give non-zero results when calculated using the applied force, an equal but opposite answer would result when calculating the work and impulse due to gravity. Thus the net work and impulse on the object is zero.</div>

    <li>Are work and impulse essentially the same as force? Consider this scenario: a weightlifter holds a heavy mass above his or her head. Does the weightlifter exert a lot of force? Is he or she doing a lot of work or producing a lot of impulse?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Impulse and work are caused by forces. However,exerting a force does not necessarily result in work or impulse since there may be other forces present: it is the net force that determines the work and impulse done on the object.</div>
