<p>The <em class="Defn">nucleus</em> of the Rutherford-Bohr atom consists of positively charged <em class="Defn">protons</em> and neutral <em class="Defn">neutrons</em>, both of which have masses of about <span class="TeX">\mathrm{1.67\times 10^{-27}\ kg}</span>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The number of protons is called the <em class="Defn">atomic number</em>; this determines which element a nuclide is.</li>
    <li>The total number of <em class="Defn">nucleons</em> (protons + neutrons) is called the <em class="Defn">mass number</em>.</li>
    <li>Most elements have more than one <em class="Defn">isotope</em>; carbon always has 6 protons but can have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons.</li>
    <li>In isotope notation, the atomic number (charge) is written as a left-subscript and the mass number (nucleons) is written as a left-superscript.</li>
    <li>In a nuclear reaction, the charge and nucleons must be conserved, in addition to energy and momentum:
        <p class="TeX">{_{6}^{14}}{\mathrm C} \rightarrow {_{7}^{14}}{\mathrm N} + {_{-1}^{0}}e + {_{0}^{0}}{\overline\nu}</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The mass of each isotope can be measured very accurately using a <em class="Defn">mass spectrometer</em>, which operates on the same principles as Thomson’s CRT experiment.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A beam is produced by subjecting the ions of the sample to an accelerating voltage:
        <p class="TeX">qV_{acc} = W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</p></li>
    <li>If the ions do not begin from rest or do not all experiences the same potential difference, we can use a <em class="Defn">velocity selector</em> (balanced electric and magnetic forces) to select only those ions with the desired speed:
        <p class="TeX">qvB = F_m = F_e = q|\vec{\mathbf E}|</p>
        <p class="TeX">v = \frac{|\vec{\mathbf E}|}{B}</p>
    </li>
    <li>In the <em class="Defn">detector</em>, a uniform magnetic field makes the ions move in uniform circular motion:
        <p class="TeX">qvB = F_m = ma = m\frac{v^2}{r}</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Radioactivity</em> refers to the natural emission of <em class="Defn">ionizing radiation</em> by certain isotopes.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Alpha particles</em> are helium-4 nuclei emitted by some large isotopes:
        <p class="TeX">{_{92}^{238}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow {_{90}^{234}}\mathrm{Th} + {_2^4}\mathrm{He}</p></li>
    <li>Alpha particles interact highly with matter and are very damaging, but have low pentrating power.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Beta particles</em> are high-speed electrons emitted when a neutron turns into a proton, such as in the <span class="TeX">\beta-</span> decay of carbon-14 shown above.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Gamma radiation</em> are photons that carry away some of the energy released by a nuclear reaction. They have the most penetrating power as they interact the least with matter.</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\alpha</span>, <span class="TeX">\beta</span>, and <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> can be distinguished by their charge (different deflection in an electric or magnetic field) and their penetrating power.</li>
    <li>The ability to ionize matter provides several methods of detecting these particles: photographic film, photomultiplier tubes, scintillation, cloud or bubble chambers, or a Geiger-Mueller tube.</li>
</ul>

<p>Radioactive decay is random; it follows an exponential probability distribution with a half-life that is characteristic of each isotope:
    <p class="TeX">N = N_0\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n</p>
    <p class="TeX">n = \frac{t}{T_{1/2}}</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Half-life</em> is defined as the time over which the probability of any individual nucleus decaying is 50%. For a large sample size, the amount remaining after one half-life will be very close to one-half of the initial amount.</li>
    <li><span class="TeX">N</span> is any measure of the amount of the radioactive isotope present, such as the number or mass of these atoms, the percentage remaining, or the activity (measured in becquerels, Bq).</li>
    <li>From a graph of <span class="TeX">N</span> vs. <span class="TeX">t</span>, find the point on the graph where the quantity remaining is half the original amount; this allows you to read the half-life from the <span class="TeX">t</span>-axis.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Radiocarbon dating</em> is used to determine the age of dead material (wood, bone, leather, etc.) based on how much radioactive carbon-14 remains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Einstein proposed the idea of <em class="Defn">mass-energy equivalence</em>:<p class="TeX">E=mc^2</p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Mass is a form of energy that can be converted to (or from) other energy forms.</li>
    <li>The energy released in a nuclear reaction is large enough that there is a measurable change in the mass!</li>
    <li>By comparing the mass of the products to the reactants, we can calculate the energy released by a reaction.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">mass defect</em> is the difference between the mass of a nuclide and its individual nucleons:
        <p class="TeX">{_{92}^{235}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow 92\left({_1^1}{\mathrm H}\right) + 143\left({_0^1}n\right)</p></li>
    <li>Multiplying the mass defect by <span class="TeX">c^2</span> gives the <em class="Defn">nuclear binding energy</em>,  the energy needed to disassemble the nucleus.</li>
    <li>A larger NBE <em>per nucleon</em> indicates a more stable isotope.</li>
    <li>Iron-56 is the most stable isotope based on the greatest NBE per nucleon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nuclei larger than iron-56 tend to undergo <em class="Defn">nuclear fission</em>, reactions where a nucleus breaks into two or more smaller nuclei.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With some isotopes, fission can be induced by <em class="Defn">neutron bombardment</em>:
        <p class="TeX">{_{92}^{235}}{\mathrm U} + {_0^1}n \rightarrow {_{92}^{236}}{\mathrm U} \rightarrow {_{56}^{141}}{\mathrm {Ba}} + {_{36}^{92}}{\mathrm {Kr}} + 3\left({_0^1}n\right)</p></li>
    <li>If the nuclear fuel exceeds <em class="Defn">critical mass</em>, each neutron absorbed has a likelihood of emitting more than one additional neutron that will itself be absorbed. This results in a <em class="Defn">chain reaction</em>.</li>
    <li>We can reduce the critical mass by <em class="Defn">enriching</em> the fuel to have a higher proportion of fissile nuclei.</li>
    <li>We can also enhance the reaction by <em class="Defn">moderating</em> the neutrons (for example by allowing them to collide with deuterium nuclei) so they have the optimal speed for creating a chain reaction.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Control rods</em> made of a material that absorbs neutrons can be used to control the rate of reaction.</li>
    <li>Pressurized heavy water can be used as both a moderator and as a coolant to collect energy from the reactor as heat.</li>
    <li>The heat can be used to generate steam that turns a turbine connected to an electrical generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nuclei smaller than iron-56 tend to undergo <em class="Defn">nuclear fusion</em>, joining together to form larger nuclei.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Because both reacting nuclei are positively charged, it is very difficult to overcome the long-range electric repulsion to move the nuclei close enough for the short-range <em class="Defn">strong nuclear force</em> to kick in and allow the fusion to occur.</li>
    <li>Fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures such as found in the core of the Sun and other stars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Protons and neutrons are <b>not</b> fundamental particles. According to the <em class="Defn">standard model</em> of particle physics, each is composed of three smaller particles called <em class="Defn">quarks</em>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Quarks are fundamental <em class="Defn">fermions</em> that experience the strong nuclear force.</li>
    <li>A proton consists of two “up” quarks and one “down” quark.</li>
    <li>A neutron consists of one “up” quark and two “down” quarks.</li>
    <li>Fundamental fermions that do not experience the strong nuclear force (electrons and neutrinos) are called <em class="Defn">leptons</em>.</li>
    <li>Neutrinos have extremely small masses, are very penetrating, and interact minimally with matter (they are non-ionizing).</li>
    <li>There are second and third generation quarks and leptons which have higher energies than the first generation ones.</li>
    <li>Fermions obey the <em class="Defn">Pauli Exclusion Principle</em>: each fermion must have a unique quantum state. This is why you cannot put an unlimitted number of electrons in an atom’s lowest energy level.</li>
    <li>Particles that do not follow the Exclusion Principle are called <em class="Defn">bosons</em>.</li>
    <li>Several fundamental bosons are responsible for all (except maybe gravity?) interactions (forces) that occur in nature...
        <ul>
            <li>Photons are responsible for electromagnetic forces.</li>
            <li>Gluons are responsible for the strong nuclear force.</li>
            <li>The <span class="TeX">Z</span> and <span class="TeX">W^\pm</span> bosons are responsible for the weak nuclear force which causes <span class="TeX">\beta-</span> and <span class="TeX">\beta+</span> decays.</li>
            <li>Gravitons (hypothesized but not yet observed) may be responsible for gravitational forces.</li>
            <li>The Higgs boson is responsible for all other particles having mass.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the twelve fundamental fermions, there is a corresponding <em class="Defn">anti-particle</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The electron’s anti-particle is called the <em class="Defn">positron</em>.</li>
    <li>Positrons have the same mass but opposite sign charge as a normal electron.</li>
    <li>Positrons are emitted in <span class="TeX">\beta+</span> decay where a proton turns into a neutron.</li>
    <li>Positrons and electrons can undergo <em class="Defn">pair annihilation</em> where all of their mass-energy is transformed into photons:
        <p class="TeX">{_{-1}^0}{e} + {_{1}^0}{\overline{e}} \rightarrow 2\left({_0^0}\gamma\right)</p></li>
    <li>If the electron/positron momenta are much smaller than the momentum of each photon, the photons must have the same wavelength and opposite directions so that their combined momentum is close to zero.</li>
</ul>
