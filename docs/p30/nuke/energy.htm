<section class="Slide"><h3>Mass &amp; Energy</h3>
<p>Albert Einstein proposed the idea of <em class="Defn">mass-energy equivalence</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>According to Einstein, mass is a form of energy that can be transformed to or from other types of energy:
        <p class="TeX">E = m c^2</p></li>
    <li>In chemical reactions, the energy released (or absorbed) in a reaction is typically on the order of <span class="TeX">\rm{10^5\ J/mol}</span>.</li>
    <li>This corresponds to a change in mass of about <span class="TeX">\rm{10^{-12}\ kg/mol}</span> which is too small to notice. In chemical reactions, mass can be considered as a conserved quantity.</li>
    <li>For nuclear reactions, the energy change is typically around <span class="TeX">\rm{10^{11}\ J/mol}</span>, resulting in a noticeable mass change of <span class="TeX">\rm{10^{-6}\ kg/mol}</span>.</li>
    <li>As we’ve already seen, energy released may take the form of kinetic energy (e.g. of the <span class="TeX">\alpha</span>, <span class="TeX">\beta-</span>, and <span class="TeX">\beta+</span> particles), photons, or neutrinos.</li>
    <li>Note that “heat” and “sound” cannot be produced directly, since these forms of energy involve the motion of molecules; nuclei exist on a much smaller distance scale than do molecules.</li>
    <li>Since the mass of isotopes can be measured extremely accurately using a mass spectrometer, we can calculate the energy change in any nuclear reaction by comparing the masses of the products to the reactant(s).</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">Calculate the energy released by the <span class="TeX">\beta-</span> decay of carbon-14.</p>
<p class="TeX">{_{6}^{14}}{\rm C} \rightarrow {_{7}^{14}}{\rm N} + {_{-1}^{0}}e + {_{0}^{0}}{\overline\nu}</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Mass Defect &amp; Nuclear Binding Energy</h3>
<p>Mass-energy calculations can be used to estimate the <em>stability</em> of various isotopes, using the rule-of-thumb that lower energy configurations tend to be more stable.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Mass defect</em> is the difference between the actual mass of an isotope and the combined mass of the individual particles that comprise it.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Nuclear binding energy</em> (NBE) is the energy equivalence of the mass defect using:
        <p class="TeX">\Delta E = \Delta\cdot m c^2</p></li>
    <li>NBE represents the amount of energy needed to break the nucleus apart into individual nucleons; for example...
        <p class="TeX">{_2^4}{\rm {He}} \rightarrow 2\left({_1^1}{\rm H}\right) + 2\left({_0^1}n\right)</p></li>
    <li>The relative stability of different isotopes can be estimated by comparing the nuclear binding energies <em>per nucleon</em>; i.e. the NBE divided by the mass number.</li>
    <li>Energies of nuclear reaction are often expressed in <em>megaelectronvolts</em>.</li>
    <li><span class="TeX">\rm{MeV/c^2}</span> is sometimes used as a unit of mass; it is defined as the mass equivalent of <span class="TeX">\rm{1\ MeV}</span> of energy.</li>
    <li>Another unit of mass is the <em class="Defn">atomic mass unit</em> (u or amu), which is defined such that carbon-12 has a mass of <em>exactly</em> 12 u.</li>
    <li>The atomic mass unit is equal to <span class="TeX">\rm{1.6605 \times 10^{-27}\ kg}</span>, a fraction of a percent smaller than the proton or neutron mass.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 2</h3>
<p class="Blue">Calculate the mass defect, NBE and NBE per nucleon for helium-4.</p>
<p class="TeX">{_2^4}{\rm {He}} \rightarrow 2\left({_1^1}{\rm H}\right) + 2\left({_0^1}n\right)</p>
