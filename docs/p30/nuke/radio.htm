<section class="Slide"><h3>Radioactivity</h3>
<p>In 1866, Henri Becquerel discovered that compounds containing uranium exposed photographic film even though they emitted no visible light, and even when the film was kept covered. This phenomenon is called <em class="Defn">radioactivity</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Marie and Pierre Curie found additional elements that exhibited this behaviour.</li>
    <li>When the emissions from radioactive isotopes were subjected to electric or magnetic fields, scientists discovered that depending on the source, there could be positive, negative, and/or neutral particles present.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img class="w24" alt="Radioactivity" src="p30/nuke/img/radio.webp"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>The positive particles were given the name “alpha” (<span class="TeX">\alpha</span>) after the first letter of the Greek alphabet.</li>
    <li>Measurements of their charge-to-mass ratio and chemical properties established that <span class="TeX">\alpha</span>-particles are fast-moving nuclei of helium-4.</li>
    <li>The negative particles were designated as “beta” (<span class="TeX">\beta</span>) and later identified as high-speed electrons.</li>
    <li>The neutral particles were called “gamma” (<span class="TeX">\gamma</span>) and later found to be extremely high-energy photons.</li>
    <li>All three types of particles have electromagnetic fields, and move with significant energy. This allows them to <em>ionize</em> regular matter that they interact with. (This is what causes the film to become exposed.)</li>
    <li>These three types of radiation are classified as <em class="Defn">ionizing radiation</em>.</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> radiation is also classified as EMR because it consists of photons.</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\alpha</span> and <span class="TeX">\beta</span> do not appear on the EM spectrum as they are <em>not</em> composed of photons.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Properties &amp; Hazards</h3>
<p>Ionizing radiation has the ability to penetrate (pass through) matter.</p>

<ul>
    <li>As the slowest of the particles with the most charge and mass, the <span class="TeX">\alpha</span> particles interact the most with the matter they pass through; they loses their energy the quickest.</li>
    <li><span class="TeX">\alpha</span> particles are generally unable to pass through a sheet of paper.</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> particles interact the least and penetrate the most because they are the fastest and have no mass or charge.</li>
    <li>It takes about 7 cm of lead to absorb 99% of the photons (depending on the photon energy).</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\beta</span> particles have medium penetrating power; they can pass through at most a few millimetres of metal.</li>
    <li>The ionizing property of <span class="TeX">\alpha</span>, <span class="TeX">\beta</span>, and <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> radiation makes them hazardous, as ionizing radiation can kill living cells or create mutations (random changes to DNA molecules) that can lead to cancers and birth defects.</li>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\alpha</span> particles are the most dangerous ones to be exposed to, since they deposit all of their energy and do a lot of damage in a small area.</li>
    <li>Fortunately, they are the easiest to protect yourself from due to their low penetrating ability.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Detection</h3>
<p>Detection of <span class="TeX">\alpha</span>, <span class="TeX">\beta</span>, and <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> radiation also depends on their ionizing abilities.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Scintillation</b>: Some materials absorb energy from high energy particles and later emit the energy as visible photons (fluorescence or phosphorescence).</li>
    <li><b>Photographic Film</b>: Ionizing radiation causes the same chemical reactions on film as visible light does.</li>
    <li><b>Wilson Cloud Chamber</b>: A container is saturated with vapour and cooled. When radiation ionizes molecules of the vapour, condensation occurs forming “cloud” tracks along the path of the particles.</li>
    <li><b>Bubble Chamber</b>: The opposite of a cloud chamber. Ionizing radiation causes bubbles of gas to form within a liquid.</li>
    <li><b>Photomultiplier Tube</b>: This device detects ionizing radiation by looking for photoelectrons released when the high energy particles strike an electrode.</li>
    <li><b>Geiger–Müller Tube</b>: A sealed metal cylinder and a rod mounted along its axis are maintained at a high voltage. When ionizing radiation enters the cylinder, it ionizes the gas and causes a burst of current that can be detected using a speaker or electronic counter.</li>
</ul>
