<section class="Slide"><h3>Nuclear Reactions</h3>
<p>Radioactivity is an example of <em class="Defn">nuclear transmutation</em>: one isotope being converted into another.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can write a reaction equation for nuclear reactions just as we do for chemical ones.</li>
    <li>For example, the alpha decay of uranium-238 can be written as:
        <p class="TeX">\rm{{_{92}^{238}}{U} \rightarrow {_{90}^{234}}{Th} + {_{2}^{4}}{He} + {_{0}^{0}}{\gamma}}</p></li>
    <li>Alpha decay occurs when a nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons as an alpha particle (helium-4).</li>
    <li>This reduces the nucleus’s atomic number by 2 and its atomic mass by 4.</li>
    <li>The energy released by this reaction takes the form of kinetic energy (the <span class="TeX">\alpha</span> is emitted at high speed) and the <span class="TeX">\gamma</span> photon.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Conservation Laws</h3>
<p class="Present TeX" data-cue="prev">\rm{{_{92}^{238}}{U} \rightarrow {_{90}^{234}}{Th} + {_{2}^{4}}{He} + {_{0}^{0}}{\gamma}}</p>
<p>Nuclear reactions must obey a number of <em class="Defn">conservation laws</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The subscripts in the reaction equation indicate the <em>charge</em> of each particle.</li>
    <li>Since charge is conserved, the total of the subscripts on each side of the equation must balance.</li>
    <li>The superscripts indicate the total number of <em>nucleons</em> (protons and neutrons) which must also balance.</li>
    <li>Nuclear reactions must conserve...
        <ol>
            <li>Energy</li>
            <li>Momentum</li>
            <li>Electric Charge</li>
            <li>Nucleons</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Mass is <em>not</em> a conserved quantity in nuclear reactions.</li>
    <li>According to Einstein mass is a form of energy that can be transformed to or from other types of energy:
        <p class="TeX">E=mc^2</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Neutrinos</h3>
<div>
    <p>An example of a beta decay reaction is:</p>
    <p class="TeX" data-cue="prev">\rm{{_{6}^{14}}{C} \rightarrow {_{7}^{14}}{N} + {_{-1}^{0}}{\beta} + {_{0}^{0}}{\overline\nu}}</p>    
</div>
<ul>
    <li>The <span class="TeX">\beta</span> particle is an electron and can also be written as <span class="TeX">{_{-1}^0}e</span>.</li>
    <li>We write the electron as having an “atomic number” of –1, because this is the electron’s charge, and total charge must be conserved.</li>
    <li>The electron’s “mass number” is 0 because the electron does not count as a nucleon.</li>
    <li>By balancing charge and nucleons, we can conclude that after <span class="TeX">\beta</span> decay, the carbon-14 nucleus must have transmuted into nitrogen-14.</li>
    <li>This means that one of the neutrons in C-14 has turned into a proton to make N-14.</li>
    <li>The electron was created to conserve charge.</li>
</ul>

</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Scientists were surprised to discover that the kinetic energy of the particle (electron) does not account for all of the energy released by the reaction!</li>
    <li>Also, the reaction does not produce any photons that could account for the missing energy.</li>
    <li>Wolfgang Pauli proposed that the reaction must produce another particle that carries the missing energy.</li>
    <li>Like the <span class="TeX">\gamma</span>, this particle has no charge, and a mass (if any) that is much smaller than an electron’s.</li>
    <li>Enrico Fermi named these particles <em class="Defn">neutrinos</em>.</li>
    <li>Because they could not be detected by any of the devices used to detect ionizing radiation, neutrinos must be non-ionizing and have very little interaction with matter; they are extremely penetrating but not dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Anti-Matter</h3>
<p>If neutrons can turn into protons it should be possible for protons to turn into neutrons!</p>
<p class="TeX">\rm{{_{11}^{22}}{Na} \rightarrow {_{10}^{22}}{Ne} + {_{1}^0}{\overline{e}} + {_0^0}{\nu}}</p>
<ul>
    <li>This process is called <em class="Defn">inverse beta decay</em> or <em class="Defn"><span class="TeX">\beta+</span>decay</em>.</li>
    <li>The <em>regular</em> <span class="TeX">\beta</span> decay is often called <em class="Defn"><span class="TeX">\beta-</span> decay</em></li>
    <li>Based on the conservation laws, <span class="TeX">\beta+</span> decay must produce a <em>positively-charged electron (!!!)</em> which scientists call a <em class="Defn">positron</em>.</li>
    <li>Positrons are the <em class="Defn">antimatter</em> equivalent of an electron.</li>
    <li>Scientists now believe that all matter particles have a corresponding antimatter particle.</li>
    <li>Regular <span class="TeX">\beta-</span> decays produce an antimatter neutrino <span class="NoWrap">(anti-neutrino, <span class="TeX">\overline\nu</span>)</span> to “balance” the normal matter electron.</li>
    <li><span class="TeX">\beta+</span> decays produce a normal matter neutrino (<span class="TeX">\nu</span>) to balance the antimatter positron.</li>
    <li>The existence of positrons can be confirmed by the fact that they react readily with electrons:
        <p class="TeX">{_{-1}^0}{e} + {_{1}^0}{\overline{e}} \rightarrow 2\left({_0^0}\gamma\right)</p></li>
    <li>A reaction like this in which a particle and its antiparticle react to produce energy is called <em class="Defn">pair annihilation</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><a target="Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Annihilation.png">
    <img class="w24" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Annihilation.png/640px-Annihilation.png" alt="Pair Annihilation"/>
</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Because momentum is conserved, the reaction must produce <em>two photons</em> with the same wavelength, moving in opposite directions.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, energy conservation requires that each photon’s energy balance the energy of one of the particles:
        <p class="TeX">E = hf = mc^2</p></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">\gamma</span> radiation is a form of energy released as a by-product of a nuclear reaction.</li>
</ul>
