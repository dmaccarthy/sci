<section class="Slide"><h3>Mass Spectrometer</h3>
<p>A <em class="Defn">mass spectrometer</em> is a device used for measuring the mass of ions based on the principles of Thomson’s experiment.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w28" alt="Mass Spectrometer" src="p30/nuke/img/ms.png"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>A potential difference is used to accelerate the ions into a beam</li>
    <li>If the ions all start from rest at the positive plate, then we can use the work-energy theorem to calculate the beam speed:
        <p class="TeX">qV_{acc} = W = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</p></li>
    <li>Some mass spectrometer designs use a <em class="Defn">velocity selector</em>.</li>
    <li>As in Thomson’s experiment, electric and magnetic fields create forces in opposite directions.</li>
    <li>The forces will balance when the particles have the desired speed:
        <p class="TeX">qvB = F_m = F_e = q|\vec{\mathbf E}|</p>
        <p class="TeX">v = \frac{|\vec{\mathbf E}|}{B}</p>
    </li>
    <li>Particles moving faster than this will experience a stronger magnetic force and be deflected; slower particles will be deflected in the opposite direction because the magnetic force will be weaker.</li>
    <li>Undeflected particles pass into a detector where there is uniform magnetic field.</li>
    <li>The mass of the particles can be determined based on the radius of the uniform circular motion:
        <p class="TeX">F_m = ma</p>
        <p class="TeX">qvB = m\frac{v^2}{r}</p>
        <p class="TeX">m = \frac{qBr}{v}</p>
    </li>
    <li>A fluorescent screen or photographic film can be used to detect where the particle hit.</li>
    <li>Modern devices use electronic detectors (like a digital camera) to measure the radius of the particles’ trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Isotopes</h3>
<p>The <em class="Defn">nucleus</em> contains the atom’s positive charge, in the form of particles called <em class="Defn">protons</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In a <em>neutral</em> atom, the number of protons and electrons are equal.</li>
    <li>Why don’t the protons repel each other?</li>
    <li>If helium (for example) has two protons to balance its two electrons, why is its mass <em>four</em> times that of hydrogen</em>?</li>
    <li>Rutherford’s nucleus also contains a second type of particle called a <em class="Defn">neutron</em>.</li>
    <li>Neutrons have approximately the same mass as a proton, but no electric charge.</li>
    <li>Neutrons (somehow!) prevent the protons from repelling each other due to their positive charge. The force that overpowers the electric repulsion is called the <em class="Defn">strong nuclear force</em>.</li>
    <li>Neutrons were detected experimentally by James Chadwick in 1932.</li>
    <li>Because neutrons have no charge, the number of neutrons does not affect the number of electrons, or the chemical behaviour of an atom.</li>
    <li>Chemically identical atoms with the same number of protons and different numbers of neutrons are called <em class="Defn">isotopes</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Atomic Number &amp; Mass Number</h3>
<p>The number of protons determines the <em class="Defn">atomic number</em> of a nuclide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Atomic number determines which element a nuclide belongs to, and thus its chemical behaviour.</li>
    <li>The total number of <em class="Defn">nucleons</em> (i.e protons and neutrons) is called the <em class="Defn">mass number</em> or atomic mass.</li>
    <li><em>Molar mass</em> (which you use in Chemistry) is the <em>average</em> of the mass numbers of all natural isotopes of an element.</li>
    <li>Most carbon atoms in nature are carbon-12, but a small percentage are carbon-13, giving carbon a molar mass of 12.01 g/mol.</li>
    <li>Do not use molar mass in nuclear physics, as we are interested in the separate isotopes, not average chemical properties.</li>
    <li>In <em class="Defn">isotope notation</em>, the chemical symbol for an element is written with the atomic number to the lower left and the atomic mass to the upper left.</li>
    <li>For example, the symbol for carbon-13 is <p class="TeX">\Large{_{\ 6}^{13}}{\mathrm C}</p></li>
    <li>Carbon-13 has 6 protons (atomic number) and 7 neutrons (<span class="TeX">13-6</span>).</li>
</ul>
