<section id="ql" class="Slide"><h3>Quarks &amp; Leptons</h3>
<p>Murray Gell-Mann proposed in 1963 that protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles; instead, they are made up of three smaller particles which Gell-Mann named <em class="Defn">quarks</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The strong nuclear force is a short-range, attractive force that acts between quarks.</li>
    <li>Scattering experiments using high-energy particle accelerators later confirmed that when other particles collide with protons or neutrons, the nucleons behave as three “scattering centres” rather than just one.</li>
    <li>Protons consist of two “up” quarks and one “down” quark.</li>
    <li>Neutrons are two “downs” and one “up”.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <p class="TeX">p = uud</p>
    <p class="TeX">n = udd</p></p>
<ul>
    <li>The fundamental particles of matter now include four <em class="Defn">first generation</em> particles: the up quark, the down quark, the electron, and the neutrino.</li>
    <li>Each of these particles has a corresponding antiparticle.</li>
    <li>Physicists discovered two additional generations of fundamental particles.</li>
    <li>The higher generation particles have the same charge as their first generation counterparts, but have much higher mass-energies.</li>
</ul>
<table class="Center Narrow">
    <tr><th>Generation</th><th colspan="2">Quarks</th><th colspan="2">Leptons</th></tr>
    <tr><td rowspan="2">1st</td><td>Down</td><td><span class="TeX">-\frac{1}{3}e</span></td><td>Electron</td><td><span class="TeX">-1e</span></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Up</td><td><span class="TeX">+\frac{2}{3}e</span></td><td><span class="TeX">\nu_e</span></td><td>0</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Top</td><td><span class="TeX">+\frac{2}{3}e</span></td><td><span class="TeX">\nu_\tau</span></td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
    <li>The electron, neutrino, their antiparticles, and their second and third generation counterparts are known collectively as <em class="Defn">leptons</em>.</li>
    <li>The first generation neutrino can also be called an electron-neutrino to distinguish it from the muon-neutrino and tau-neutrino.</li>
    <li>Unlike quarks, leptons do <em>not</em> experience the strong nuclear force.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="med" class="Slide"><h3>Mediating Particles</h3>
<p>In the quantum field theory, fundamental particles exert forces on each other by exchanging <em class="Defn">mediating particles</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For example, all charged particles are constantly emitted and absorbing photons.</li>
    <li>The photon is the mediating particle for the electromagnetic force.</li>
    <li>The table below lists the fundamental mediating particles that are responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature...</li>
</ul>
<table class="Center">
    <tr><th>Particle(s)</th><th>Force</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Photon</td><td>Electromagnetic</td></tr>
    <tr><td><span class="TeX">Z</span>, <span class="TeX">W^\pm</span></td><td>Weak Nuclear</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Gluon</td><td>Strong Nuclear</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Graviton</td><td>Gravity</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
    <li>The weak nuclear force is the one responsible for beta-type decays.</li>
    <li>This force has been successfully “unified” with the electromagnetic force; physicists often refer to the “electroweak” force.</li>
    <li>There is another fundamental particle called the <em class="Defn">Higgs boson</em> that is responsible for other particles acquiring mass.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="other" class="Slide"><h3>Other Particles</h3>
<p>Fundamental particles can join together to form additional particles.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Three quark combinations are called <em class="Defn">baryons</em>, which include protons and neutrons.</li>
    <li>Combinations of one quark and one antiquark are called <em class="Defn">mesons</em>.</li>
    <li>Particles that experience the strong nuclear force (including all quarks, baryons, and mesons, but not leptons or mediating particles) are called <em class="Defn">hadrons</em>.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Fermions</em> include all quarks and leptons as well as combinations of an odd number of fermions (e.g. baryons).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Bosons</em> include the mediating particles and combinations of an even number of fermions (e.g. mesons).</li>
    <li><b>Pauli Exclusion Principle</b>: Fermions exist in <em>unique</em> quantum states.</li>
    <li>This is why the electrons in an atom (with more than two electrons) cannot all be in the first energy level at the same time; electrons are fermions.</li>
    <li>This restriction does not apply to bosons. For example, a laser can produce a coherent beam of light because photons are bosons; many photons can be created in the same quantum state.</li>
</ul>
