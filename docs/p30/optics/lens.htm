<section class="Slide"><h3>Converging &amp; Diverging Lenses</h3>
<p>Lenses form images by refraction as the light passes from the air into the lens, and back into the air.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the <em class="Defn">thin lens approximation</em>, the two consecutive refractions are considered as a single change in the direction of the light ray.</li>
    <li>Lenses can be shaped to focus paraxial incident rays to a focal point just as mirrors do.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">converging lens</em> has a real focus while a <em class="Defn">diverging lens</em> has a virtual focus.</li>
    <li>Because light travels through the lens (in contrast to a mirror), there are focal points on <em>both sides</em> of the lens.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">primary focus</em> is on the opposite side of the lens from the object when it is real, and on the same side when it is virtual. The <em class="Defn">secondary focus</em> is always opposite from the primary focus.</li>
    <li>The index of refraction for most lenses is slightly different for different wavelengths (colours) of light. This means that the focal point will be slightly different for different wavelengths as well. This phenomenon is called <em class="Defn">chromatic aberration</em>.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Principal Ray Diagrams</h3>
<p>Light rays that pass through the <em class="Defn">optical centre</em> of a lens will not change direction because the two sides of the lens are parallel at this point.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg class="w28" data-svg2="p30/optics/img/pr.js#diag_toggle#1;2;5"></svg></p>
<p>The three principal rays for a thin lens are as follows...</p>
<ol>
    <li>An incident ray through the optical centre (C) will not be refracted at all.</li>
    <li>A paraxial ray will be refracted along a line through the primary focus (F).</li>
    <li>An incident ray that is aligned with the secondary focus (F’) will refract parallel to the principal axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a <em class="Defn">diverging</em> lens, the lens is shaped so as to refract the light <em>away</em> from a <em>virtual</em> focus.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg class="w28" data-svg2="p30/optics/img/pr.js#diag_toggle#1;-2;5"></svg></p>
<ul><li>A positive value of <span class="TeX">f</span> indicates a real focus (converging lens) and a negative <span class="TeX">f</span> indicates a virtual focus (diverging lens)</li></ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Equations</h3>
<p>We can identify pairs of <em>similar triangles</em> on the principal ray diagram to derive equations for the converging and diverging lens, just as we did for curved mirrors.</p>
<p>Converging and diverging lenses obey the <em>same equations</em> as concave and convex mirrors:</p>
<p class="TeX">\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}</p>
<p class="TeX">m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}</p>
