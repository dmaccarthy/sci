<p>Because reflection and refraction both change the direction of a light ray, <em class="Defn">image formation</em> can occur.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Images are formed where the reflected or refracted rays <em>appear</em> to originate from.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Real images</em> are produced where the reflected/refracted rays converge; real images can be projected, for example onto a screen or a digital camera sensor.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Virtual images</em>, which cannot be projected, are produced when the reflected/refracted rays diverge; we can locate the image by extending these rays backwards to locate their apparent source.</li>
    <li>Images can also be classified as enlarged/reduced and upright/inverted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Curved mirrors and lenses have a <em class="Defn">focal point</em>; a point along the <em class="Defn">principal axis</em> through which all <em class="Defn">paraxial</em> incident rays are focussed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Curved mirrors are usually shaped as a <em>parabaloid</em>, which produces a sharp focus.</li>
    <li>Spherical mirrors exhibit <em class="Defn">spherical aberration</em>; the focus is spread out rather than at a single point.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Chromatic aberration</em> refers to the fact that in lenses the index of refraction may depend on the frequency of the light, causing different colours to have different focal points.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><a href="./#p30/optics/">Principal rays</a></b> are rays that we can draw without having to measure any angles, that allow us to find the location and properties of an image.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object parallel to the principal axis. The reflected/refracted ray will pass through<sup>a</sup> or away from<sup>b</sup> the focal point.</li>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object in line with the focus<sup>c</sup>. The reflected/refracted ray will propagate parallel to the principal axis.</li>
    <li>Draw an incident ray from the object in line with the centre of curvature<sup>d</sup> or the centre of the lens itself. The ray will reflect straight back on itself (mirrors) or propagate with no change of direction (lenses).</li>
</ol>
<p>
    <sup>a</sup> - Applies to concave mirrors and converging lenses (<span class="TeX">f>0</span>).<br/>
    <sup>b</sup> - Applies to convex mirrors and diverging lenses (<span class="TeX">f<0</span>).<br/>
    <sup>c</sup> - Use the secondary focus for lenses.<br/>
    <sup>d</sup> - For mirrors, the centre of curvature is at <em>double</em> the focal length.
</p>
<p>For both mirrors and lenses, we can calculate the location of the image and determine whether it is real or virtual by solving:</p>
<p class="TeX">\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}</p>
<p>The <em class="Defn">magnification</em> tells us whether the image is upright or inverted and enlarged or reduced:</p>
<p class="TeX">m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}</p>
