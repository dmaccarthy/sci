<section id="ccv" class="Slide"><h3>Concave Mirror</h3>
<p>Curved mirrors are generally classified as concave or convex.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">concave mirror</em> has its reflective side on the inside of the curve.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><img class="w24" alt="Concave" src="img/concave.png"/></p>
<ul>
    <li >The line joining the centre of the mirror’s surface (called the <em class="Defn">vertex</em>) to the centre of curvature (C) is called the <em class="Defn">principal axis</em>.</li>
    <li>Incident rays that are parallel to the principal axis are called <em class="Defn">paraxial</em>.</li>
    <li>Paraxial rays that strike the mirror <em>close to</em> the vertex will reflect through a point halfway between the vertex and centre. This point is called the <em class="Defn">focus</em> of the mirror.</li>
</ul>

<p>One application of this phenomenon is a satellite dish.</p>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>The signals from the satellite are the parallel incident rays.</li>
    <li>The dish concentrates these rays to the focal point where the receiver is located.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Incident rays that are <em>not</em> extremely close to the principal axis will not reflect through the focus.</li>
    <li>This fact — that spherical mirrors do not have a precise focus for all paraxial rays — is called <em class="Defn">spherical aberration.</em></li>
    <li>This means that sphere-shaped mirrors produce fuzzy images.</li>
    <li>Most curved mirrors are shaped as <em class="Defn">paraboloids</em> instead of spheres, because paraboloids have a sharp focus.</li>
</ul>

<section id="cvx" class="Slide"><h3>Convex Mirror</h3>
<p>A <em class="Defn">convex mirror</em> has its reflective side on the outside of the curve.</p>
<p class="Center"><img class="w24" alt="Concave" src="img/convex.png"/></p>
<ul>
    <li>There is still a focus midway between the vertex and centre of curvature, but the reflected rays travel directly <em>away</em> from the focal point.</li>
    <li>This focus is called a <em class="Defn">virtual focus</em>.</li>
    <li>Concave mirrors have a <em class="Defn">real</em> focus.</li>
</ul>

<section id="pr" class="Slide"><h3>Principal Rays</h3>
<p>For curved mirrors, we can use the focal point to draw two of the reflected rays without having to measure any angles.</p>
<p class="Center"><iframe class="SD" src="../../applet/ray.html?embed=1" width="720" height="405" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe></p>
<ol>  
    <li>An incident ray parallel to the principal axis will reflect through (or away from, if the mirror is convex) the focus.</li>
    <li>An incident ray in line with the focus will reflect parallel to the principal axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a third ray that can be drawn using the centre of curvature.</p>
<ol start="3">  
    <li>An incident ray in line with the centre of curvature will reflect directly back through the centre of curvature (since the angles of incidence and reflection will be 0º).</li>
</ol>
<p>We typically define the following variables for curved mirror situations:</p>
<div  class="Center">
   <p><span class="TeX">f</span> = Distance from vertex to focus</p>     
   <p><span class="TeX">d_o</span> = Distance from vertex to object</p>     
   <p><span class="TeX">d_i</span> = Distance from vertex to image</p>     
   <p><span class="TeX">m</span> = Magnification of the image</p>     
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Positive values are used for <span class="TeX">f</span> and <span class="TeX">d_i</span> to indicate the focus or image is real.</li>
    <li>Negative values are used for a virtual focus or image.</li>
    <li>An image is <em class="Defn">upright</em> (<span class="TeX">m>0</span>) when it is on the same side of the principal axis as the object, and <em class="Defn">inverted</em> (<span class="TeX">m<0</span>) when on the opposite side.</li>
    <li>An image is <em class="Defn">enlarged</em> or <em class="Defn">magnified</em> (<span class="TeX">|m|>1</span>) when it is further from the principal axis than the object, and <em class="Defn">reduced</em> (<span class="TeX">|m|<1</span>) when it is closer.</li>
</ul>
