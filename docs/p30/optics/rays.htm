<p>Because light has a very small wavelength, in most situations it does not diffract significantly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">ray model</em> of light assumes that light can be treated as travelling in straight lines, except where it reflects or refracts from a boundary.</li>
    <li>When light rays change direction due to reflection (mirror) or refraction (lens), light may appear to originate from a place other than its actual origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point where the reflected/refracted light <em>appears</em> to originate is the <em class="Defn">image</em> of the object where the light actually originates.</p>

    <li>This ray diagram shows refraction of light from a submerged object at the surface of the pond.</li>
    <li>The rays shown in blue are the <em class="Defn Blue">incident rays</em>; the rays that travel from the object to the reflective or refractive surface.</li>
    <li>The rays shown in red are the <em class="Defn Red">refracted rays</em> that change direction at the surface according to Snell’s Law.</li>
    <li>To an observer outside the water, the refracted rays <em>appear</em> to be coming from a point that is shallower than the object actually is!</li>
    <li>The <em>apparent</em> source of the refracted rays is the location of the <em class="Defn">image</em>.</li>
    <li>The dashed grey lines that extend the refracted rays back to the image are called <em class="Defn Grey">virtual rays</em>. The image is called a <em class="Defn Grey">virtual image</em>.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the reflected/refracted rays actually cross without having to be extended backwards. An image formed by <em>real</em> reflected/refracted rays is called a <em class="Defn">real image</em>.</li>
    <li>Real images can be projected onto a screen (e.g. as in a movie projector or a camera.) Virtual images cannot, because there are no actual light rays there.</li>
    <li>When all the reflected/refracted rays from a point object converge to form an image at a single point, the image will be sharp.</li>
    <li>A fuzzy image is produced when the rays from a single point converge over a region larger than a single point.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">ray diagram</em> is an illustration of the incident and reflected/refracted rays that we use to locate the image.</li>
    <li>To draw a ray diagram, you will need a protractor to ensure that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence for reflection, while the angle of refraction must be calculated from the Snell’s Law formula.</li>

    <li>An object is placed 10 cm in front of a plane (flat) mirror, represented by the <span class="noWrap"><span class="TeX">y</span>-axis</span> in the diagram below. Draw a ray diagram (using three arbitrary incident rays) to locate the image of the object’s top. Is the image real or virtual? Is it enlarged, reduced, or the same size as the object? Is it “sharp” or “fuzzy”? Explain.
        <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/optics/img/rays.js#plane"></svg></p>
    </li>

    <li>An object is placed in front of a concave, spherical mirror of radius 6.0 cm as illustrated. The top of the object is located at coordinates (4.0, 2.0) cm, using the mirror’s vertex as the origin. Draw an accurate ray diagram to locate the <em>image</em> of the object’s top. For your convenience, the normal has been drawn as a dashed line at an arbitrary point on the mirror. Is the image real or virtual? Is it “sharp” or “fuzzy”? Explain.

    </li>

    <li>An object is placed in front of a <em>convex</em>, spherical mirror of radius 6.0 cm as illustrated. The top of the object is located at coordinates (2.0, 2.0) cm, using the mirror’s vertex as the origin. Draw an accurate ray diagram to locate the <em>image</em> of the object’s top. For your convenience, the normal has been drawn as a dashed line at an arbitrary point on the mirror. Is the image real or virtual? Is it “sharp” or “fuzzy”? Explain.
        <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/optics/img/rays.js#convex"></svg></p>
    </li>

    <li>Are there any incident rays that you could have drawn in the preceding ray diagrams for which you would not need a protractor to draw the reflected ray?</li>
    <p class="Answer">If the incident ray passes through C, it will strike the mirror at normal incidence (<span class="TeX">\theta_1</span> = 0) so it will reflect straight back through the centre. If the incident ray strikes the mirror at V, the reflected ray will pass through a point directly below the object and the same distance from the principal axis.</p>

    <li>A coin lies at the bottom of a 10.0 cm deep fish tank. The water has a refractive index of <span class="TeX">n</span> = 1.33. Draw an accurate ray diagram to locate the image of the coin produced by refraction from the water-air boundary, represented by the <span class="noWrap"><span class="TeX">x</span>-axis</span>. Use three arbitrary rays for your ray diagram. Show your calculation of the refraction angle for each of the three incident rays.
