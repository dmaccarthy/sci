<p>Because light has a very small wavelength, in most situations it does not diffract significantly.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">ray model</em> of light assumes that light can be treated as travelling in straight lines, except where it reflects or refracts from a boundary.</li>
    <li>When light rays change direction due to reflection (mirror) or refraction (lens), light may appear to originate from a place other than its actual origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point where the reflected/refracted light <em>appears</em> to originate is the <em class="Defn">image</em> of the object where the light actually originates.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This ray diagram shows refraction of light from a submerged object at the surface of the pond.</li>
    <li>The rays shown in blue are the <em class="Defn Blue">incident rays</em>; the rays that travel from the object to the reflective or refractive surface.</li>
    <li>The rays shown in red are the <em class="Defn Red">refracted rays</em> that change direction at the surface according to Snell’s Law.</li>
    <li>To an observer outside the water, the refracted rays <em>appear</em> to be coming from a point that is shallower than the object actually is!</li>
    <li>The <em>apparent</em> source of the refracted rays is the location of the <em class="Defn">image</em>.</li>
    <li>The dashed grey lines that extend the refracted rays back to the image are called <em class="Defn Grey">virtual rays</em>. The image is called a <em class="Defn Grey">virtual image</em>.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the reflected/refracted rays actually cross without having to be extended backwards. An image formed by <em>real</em> reflected/refracted rays is called a <em class="Defn">real image</em>.</li>
    <li>Real images can be projected onto a screen (e.g. as in a movie projector or a camera.) Virtual images cannot, because there are no actual light rays there.</li>
    <li>When all the reflected/refracted rays from a point object converge to form an image at a single point, the image will be sharp.</li>
    <li>A fuzzy image is produced when the rays from a single point converge over a region larger than a single point.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">ray diagram</em> is an illustration of the incident and reflected/refracted rays that we use to locate the image.</li>
    <li>To draw a ray diagram, you will need a protractor to ensure that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence for reflection, while the angle of refraction must be calculated from the Snell’s Law formula.</li>
