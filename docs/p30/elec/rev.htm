<p>Net <em class=Defn">electric charge</em> is the difference between the number of protons and electrons in an
    object.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Neutral objects can become charged by <em class=Defn">friction</em>, <em class=Defn">conduction</em>, or <em class=Defn">induction</em>.</li>
        <li>Opposite charges attract; like charges repel.</li>
        <li>Neutral objects that can be <em class=Defn">polarized</em> will attract to both positive and negative charges.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Electric charge is a <em class=Defn">conserved</em> quantity.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The standard SI unit of electric charge is the Coulomb (C).</li>
        <li>The charge of a single proton or electron is called the elementary charge (<span class="TeX">+e</span> for protons and <span class="TeX">–e</span> for electrons):
            <p class="TeX">1 e = 1.60\times 10^{–19}\ \rm{C}</p></li>
        <li>Millikan determined the elementary charge by balancing the electric and gravitational forces on an oil drop.</li>    
    </ul>
    
    <p>The force between two uniform, sphere-shaped charges, is given by <em class=Defn">Coulomb’s Law</em>:
        <p class="TeX">|{\vec{\bf F}}_e| = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}</p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The value of Coulomb’s constant is determined experimentally to be
            <p class="TeX">k = 8.99\times 10^9\ \rm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{C^2}}</p></li>
        <li>For multiple charges, the net electric force is the vector total of the electric force due to each individual field charge.</li>   
    </ul>
    
    <p>The <em class=Defn">electric field</em> is defined as the ratio of the electric force to the <em class=Defn">test charge</em> (the charge <em>experiencing</em> the electric force):
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf E} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}_e}{q}</p></p>
    <ul>   
        <li>The electric field created by a sphere-shaped <em class=Defn">source</em> (<span class="TeX">Q</span>) is:
            <p class="TeX">|\vec{\bf E}| = \frac{kQ}{r^2}</p></li>
        <li>The direction of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf E}</span> indicates the direction of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_e</span> acting on <em>positive</em> test charges. For negative test charges, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_e</span> is opposite to <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf E}</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On an <em class=Defn">electric field diagram</em> arrows show the direction of the force on positive test charges.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Field lines point away from positive field charges and towards negative field charges.</li>
        <li>The strength of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf E}</span> is indicated by how close together the field lines are.</li>
        <li>“Crossing points” are places where the net electric field is zero.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A (nearly) <em class=Defn">uniform electric field</em> is produced by two parallel, oppositely charged conducting plates.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coulomb’s formula does not apply because the charged objects are not spherical!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Test charges within the electric field have <em class=Defn">electric potential energy</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The electric field does work (transforms energy between electric potential and kinetic) when the test charges move.</li>
        <li><em class=Defn">Electric potential difference</em> is defined as the ratio of the work done by the electric field, compared to the test charge:
            <p class="TeX">\Delta V = \frac{\Delta E}{q} = \frac{{\vec{\bf F}}_e\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}}{q} = \vec{\bf E}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</p></li>
        <li>The unit of potential difference is the volt: <span class="TeX">\rm 1\ V = 1\ J/C</span>.</li>
        <li>Potential difference is also called voltage.</li>
        <li>For a test charge moving in a uniform field, the motion (e.g. velocity and acceleration) can be determined using uniform accelerated motion, Newton’s Laws, and/or energy conservation.</li>
    </ul>
