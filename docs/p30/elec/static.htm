<section class="Slide"><h3>Electric Charge</h3>
    <p>Matter is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protons have a <em>positive charge</em>.</li>
        <li>Electrons have a <em>negative charge</em>.</li>
        <li>Neutrons have no charge.</li>
        <li>Objects that contain <em>equal</em> numbers of protons and electrons are <em class="Defn">neutral</em>.</li>
        <li>Objects that have an excess of electrons are <em class="Defn">negatively charged</em>.</li>
        <li>Objects that have a defecit of electrons (i.e. more protons) are <em class="Defn">positively charged</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For everyday charged objects, the difference between the protons and electrons is relatively small.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An excess of a single electron for every <em>billion</em> protons can produce a very large net charge!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A coulomb is defined as the amount of charge carried by a 1-ampere current in 1 second:
            <p class="TeX">\rm 1\ C = 1\ A\cdot s</p>
        </li>
        <li>The charge of a single proton or electron is called the <em>elementary charge</em> unit (<i>e</i>).</li>
        <li>The conversion factor is:<p class="TeX">1\ e = 1.60\times 10^{-19}\ {\mathrm C}</p></li>
        <li>A coulomb is a very large amount of charge; we often use <em>micro</em>coulombs (μC) or even <em>nano</em>coulombs (nC).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Objects with opposite sign charges attract; objects with the same sign charge repel.</p>
    <p>Like energy and momentum, charge is a conserved quantity.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="Slide"><h3>Charging Methods</h3>
    <p>There are three common methods for creating charged objects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em class="Defn">Friction</em>: Two different materials are rubbed against each other. The material with the greater affinity for electrons becomes negative and the other becomes positive.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Conduction</em>: A neutral object is placed in contact with a charged object so that the net charge is shared. Both objects end up with the same sign charge.</li>
        <li>
            <em class="Defn">Induction</em>: A charged object is used to attract the opposite sign charge onto a neutral object from a third object (which is often the Earth.)
            <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/elec/img/static.js#induct" class="s20"></svg></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="Slide"><h3>Conduction</h3>
    <p>Objects that permit the movement of charge easily are known as <em class="Defn">conductors</em>.</p>
    <p>Objects that prevent the movement of charge are known as <em class="Defn">insulators</em>.</p>
    <p>Objects that allow the movement of charge with significant loss of energy are known as <em class="Defn">resistors</em>.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="Slide"><h3>Polarization</h3>
    <p>When a neutral object is placed near a charged object, electrons may move within the object to form two <em class="Defn">poles</em>.</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/elec/img/static.js#pole" class="s20"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The negative pole will be the region where electrons are attracted to.</li>
        <li>The positive pole will be the region where electrons are repeled from.</li>
        <li>The pole closest to the charged object will be the one that has the opposite sign.</li>
        <li>A <em class="Defn">polarized</em> object will attract to charges of either sign.</li>
        <li>Some substances, including water, methanol, and ethanol, have a permanent polarization due to their molecular structure.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="Slide"><h3>Electroscope</h3>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">metal-leaf electroscope</em> is a device for detecting charge.</p>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p30/elec/img/static.js#escope" class="s10"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A charged object brought close to the top of the electroscope will polarize it.</li>
        <li>The ball will have the opposite sign as the charge, and the leaves will have the same sign.</li>
        <li>The leaves will repel each other due to having the same sign.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the electroscope is given a net charge, the ball and leaves will all have the same sign as the charge spreads out as much as it can due to repulsion.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the same sign charge is brought near the top, the leaves will become more charged and spread farther apart.</li>
        <li>If the opposite sign charge is brought near the top, the leaves will become less charged and will become less separated.</li>
        <li>The leaves will never have opposite signs, and therefore will never attract past vertical.</li>
    </ul>
