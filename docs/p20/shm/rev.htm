<p><em class="Defn">Simple harmonic motion</em> (SHM) is a type of <em class="Defn">oscillation</em>; a back-and-forth motion centred at the object’s <em class="Defn">equilibrium</em>.
<ul>
    <li>SHM is <em>caused</em> by a <em class="Defn">restoring force</em> that is <em>proportional</em> to how far the object is from its equilibium (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf x}</span>); the farther from equilibrium the stronger the net force:
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = -k\vec{\bf x}</p></li>
    <li>The potential energy associated with the restoring force is<p class="TeX">E_p = \frac{1}{2}kx^2</p></li>
</ul>

<p>SHM produces a graph of position versus time that can be described mathematically by a <span class="TeX">\sin</span> or <span class="TeX">\cos</span> function.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">amplitude</em>, <span class="TeX">A</span>, is the maximum distance from equilibrium.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">period</em> of SHM is the time for one complete oscillation or cycle of the motion. Period is determined by the strength of the restoring force and the mass:
        <p class="TeX">T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}</p></li>
    <li>Period does <em>not</em> depend on the amplitude. For larger amplitudes, the mass covers a greater distance in the <em>same</em> amount of time because its speed is faster.</li>
    <li>The reciprocal of the period is called the <em class="Defn">frequency</em> and is measured in hertz (1 Hz = 60 rpm).
        <p class="TeX">f = \frac{1}{T}</p></li>
    <li>The maximum velocity (the steepest part of the graph) occurs when the object passes through equilibrium.
        <p class="TeX">v_{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T}</p></li>
    <li>A graph of the object’s velocity has the same shape and period as its position, but the graph is shifted one-quarter of a period.
        (Click the graph to toggle between <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf x}</span>, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}</span>, and <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf a}</span> graphs.)</li>
</ul> 
<p class="Center"><svg class="s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/shm.js#v_t#[0,1]"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>The velocity and position are “out of sync” because it has the greatest speed (most <span class="TeX">E_k</span>) when it is closest to equilibirum (least <span class="TeX">E_p</span>).</li>
    <li>A graph of the object’s acceleration is shifted another quarter of a period.
        <p class="TeX">a_{max} = \frac{v_{max}^2}{A} = \frac{4\pi^2 A}{T^2}</p></li>
    </ul>
<ul>
    <li>The relationships for <span class="TeX">v_{max}</span> and <span class="TeX">a_{max}</span> are similar to uniform circular motion because the <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-components of UCM are cosine and sine functions!</li>
</ul>

<p>The motion of a <em class="Defn">simple pendulum</em> is <em>approximately</em> SHM when the angle of the swing is less than about 30°.</p>
<p class="TeX">T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}</p>
<ul><li>For larger angles the restoring force is not in direct proportion to the distance from equilibrium, due to the curved trajectory of the object.</li></ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Mechanical resonance</em> is the tendancy of the amplitude to grow very large when an oscillator is “driven” at its harmonic or resonant frequency.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This happens because when the driving force is properly “synced” with the oscillations, it will always do a positive amount of work.</li>
    <li>Mechanical resonance has important implications for designing buildings and other structures that can withstand earthquakes.</li>
</ul>

    <li>The amplitude of the building swaying will grow large due to mechanical resonance when the frequency of the seismic waves matches the resonant frequency of the building. Changing the mass distribution will change the resonance frequency and may prevent resonance from occuring.</li>
