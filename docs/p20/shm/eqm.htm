<section class="Slide"><h3>Equilibrium</h3>
<p>An <em class="Defn">equilibrium</em> is a position where objects experience zero net force.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg class="s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/eqm.js#eqm"></svg></p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>An object placed at rest at equilibrium will remain at rest there, according to Newton’s Laws.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">In the diagram above, the equilibiums are the highest and lowest points, where the normal force exactly balances the gravity force.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">An equilibrium is <em class="Defn">unstable</em> when an object <em>close to</em> the equilibrium experiences a net force that accelerates it <em>away</em> from the equilibrium position.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Near the top of a hill, the unbalanced force produced by the gravity and normal forces points downhill, away from the equilibrium at the top.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">An equilibrium is <em class="Defn">stable</em> when objects <em>close to</em> the equilibrium experience an unbalanced force that accelerates the object back <em>toward</em> equilibrium.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Near the bottom of a valley, the gravity and normal forces produce an unbalanced force that pulls the object back toward its equilibrium at the bottom.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The net force near a stable equilibrium may be described as a <em class="Defn">restoring force</em> because it acts to restore the equilibrium.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Objects near a stable equilibrium will move back-and-forth across the equilibrium, as a result of their inertia which causes them to “overshoot”. This type of motion is called an <em class="Defn">oscillation</em>.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Simple Harmonic Motion</h3>
<p class="Center"><svg class="Graph s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/eqm.js#x_t"></svg></p>
<p data-cue="+">The simplest mathematical function that can describe an oscillation is a sinusoidal (sine or cosine) function.</p>
<p data-cue="+">Motion that can be described exactly by a sinusoidal function is called <em class="Defn">simple harmonic motion</em> (SHM).</p>
<p data-cue="+">SHM is characterized by two quantities that can be measured from the <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}{\rm -}t</span> graph:</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li><em class="Defn">Amplitude</em> (<span class="TeX">A</span>) is the maximum distance that the object moves from its equilibrium position.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The graph above uses the equilibrium position as the origin.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">We use the symbol <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}</span> for the position relative to an <em>arbitrary</em> origin, and <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf x}</span> as the position relative to equilibrium.</li>
	<li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Period</em> (<span class="TeX">T</span>) is the time it takes for each cycle or repetition of the motion.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The reciprocal of period is called <em class="Defn">frequency</em>:<p class="TeX">f = {1\over T}</p></li>
    <li data-cue="+">The unit of frequency is called hertz: Hz = s<sup>–1</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="+">We will see in a future lesson that SHM occurs when the restoring force is <em>directly proportional</em> to the object’s distance from equilibrium.</p>
<ul data-cue="+"><li>E.g. an object will experience exactly twice as much net force when it is 10 cm from equilibrium compared to when it is only 5 cm from equilibrium.</li></ul>

<ol>
    <li>A simple pendulum is constructed by hanging a mass from a string and attaching the other end of the string to a fixed location. If we can neglect air resistance, the motion of the mass will be determined by the gravity and tension forces.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Draw a free body diagram for the mass when it is at its equilibrium position. Explain how you know this position is the equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Because the gravity force is vertically down, equilibrium occurs when the tension force is directly up.</p>
            <p class="Center"><svg class="FBD s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/eqm.js#pend_eq"></svg></p>
        </div>
    
        <li>Determine whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable. To do this, draw a free body diagram for the mass close to equilibrium, and determine whether the net force is directed toward or away from the equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Stable. When the mass is to the left of equilibrium, the tension force will be angled to the right. The net force will be a restoring force directed back toward the equilibrium.</p>
            <p class="Center"><svg class="FBD s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/eqm.js#pend"></svg></p>
        </div>
    
        <li>Comment on the statement: “The mass has the least potential energy when it is passing through its equilibrium position.”</li>
        <div class="Answer Top">This is true for the pendulum because the equilibrium is the lowest point of the motion so the gravitational potential energy (<span class="TeX">mgh</span>) is at a minimum.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A mass hanging from a spring oscillates up and down as shown in the graph below. The graph uses an arbitrary origin.
        <p class="Center"><svg class="Graph s24" data-svg2="p20/shm/img/eqm.js#mass"></svg></p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Use the graph to determine the (i) equilibrium position, (ii) period, and (iii) amplitude of the motion. Show your calculations.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p>Equilibrium is halfway (average) between the lowest and highest points on the graph: <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}_{eq} = \rm{\frac{-0.15\ cm + 0.45\ cm}{2} = +0.15\ cm}</p></p>
<p>Amplitude is the difference between the highest point and the equilibrium position: <p class="TeX">A = \rm{0.45\ cm - 0.15\ cm = 0.30\ cm}</p></p>
<p>Period is the difference between the time coordinates of two consecutive “peaks” on the graph: <p class="TeX">T = \rm{ = (2.1 - 0.6)\ s = 1.5\ s}</p></p>
        </div>
    
        <li>Calculate the frequency of the motion.</li>
        <div class="Answer"><p class="TeX">f = \frac{1}{T} = \rm{\frac{1}{1.5\ s} = 0.67\ Hz}</p></div>
    
        <li>Mark a point on the graph where the object is passing through its equilibrium. Draw a tangent line to the graph through this point. Would you agree that this line is steeper than any other place on the graph? Use the concept of energy conservation to explain why the object should have the greatest speed while it is passing through equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p><a href="javascript:$('svg > g.MassHide').fadeToggle()">Click to draw the tangent line on the graph.</a></p>
            <p>Since equilibrium is the point where the potential energy is least, the kinetic energy should be at its greatest.</p>
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the slope of the tangent line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>The endpoints of the tangent line are (1.43 s, –0.25 cm) and (2.03 s, 0.50 cm). The slope is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">k = \frac{\Delta\vec{\bf d}}{\Delta t} = \rm \frac{(0.50 - (-0.25))\ cm}{(2.03-1.43)\ s} = 1.3\ cm/s</p>
        </div>

        <li>Calculus predicts that for sinusoidal functions, the amplitude, period, and equilibrium (maximum) speed are related by the equation:
<p class="TeX">v_{max}=\frac{2\pi A}{T}</p>
Confirm that this relationship correctly predicts the slope you calculated in (d).</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">v_{max} = \frac{2\pi A}{T} = \rm{\frac{2\pi\cdot 0.30\ cm}{1.5\ s} = 1.3\ cm/s}</p>
        </div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>A bass guitar player plays a note with a frequency of 40 Hz. The bass is connected to an amplifier which causes a loudspeaker to oscillate at this frequency and with an amplitude of 2.0 mm.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the period of the oscillations.</li>
        <div class="Answer"><p class="TeX">T = \frac{1}{f} = \rm{\frac{1}{40\ Hz} = 0.025\ s}</p></div>

        <li>Draw a graph of the oscillations (the motion of the moving parts within the loudspeaker) for two complete periods.</li>

        <li>Define <em class="Defn">equilibrium</em>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">A position where an object experiences zero net force, meaning it will remain at rest if it is at rest initially.</div>

        <li>Explain the difference between a <em class="Defn">stable</em> and <em class="Defn">unstable</em> equilibrium.</li>
        <div class="Answer">A stable equilibrium happens when objects <em>close to</em> the equilibrium experience a <em>restoring force</em> directed back toward the equilibrium.
            An unstable equilibrium occurs when the net force acts away from the equilibrium position.</div>

        <li>Define <em class="Defn">restoring force</em> and <em class="Defn">oscillation</em>.</li>
        <div class="Answer">A restoring force is a net force that acts to accelerate the object back toward its equilibrium. An oscillation is a back-and-forth motion, centred on the equilibrium position, caused by the restoring force.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">simple harmonic motion</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">SHM is a type of oscillation where the object’s motion is described by a sine or cosine function.
        SHM occurs when the restoring force is <em>directly proportional</em> to the distance from equilibrium.</div>
