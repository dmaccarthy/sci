<section id="r" class="Slide"><h3>Mechanical Resonance</h3>
<p>A child on a swing behaves like a simple pendulum, with its own frequency and period given by the equation:</p>
<p class="TeX">T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}</p>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>To push the child on a swing, you must push with the same frequency as the pendulum to ensure that you are always pushing forward and causing the child to gain energy:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Delta E=\vec{\mathbf{F}}\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf{d}}</p>
</div>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Imagine if we arranged to push the child at completely random times...</li>
    <li data-cue="+">It would be just as likely that the force would be in the wrong direction, causing the child to lose energy as to gain.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When a force acts on a system with the same frequency as the system’s natural frequency of oscillation, scientists call this <em class="Defn">mechanical resonance</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The system’s natural frequency is also called the <em class="Defn">resonant frequency</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="a" class="Slide"><h3>Applications</h3>
<p data-cue="+">Mechanical resonance means that a force acting at a resonant frequency will add energy to the system, causing the amplitude to grow over time.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>One important application of mechanical resonance is in designing buildings that can withstand earthquakes.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Buildings tend to sway with a resonant frequency.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When an earthquake causes the ground to shake at the building’s resonant frequency, the building is at risk of collapse.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Engineers can design features that can alter the resonant frequency and/or “damp” the oscillations to reduce the risk of collapse.</li>
</ul>
