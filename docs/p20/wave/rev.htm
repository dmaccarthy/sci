<p>A <em class="Defn">mechanical wave</em> is a <em>disturbance</em> that <em>transports energy</em> through a <em>medium</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>According to mathematician Joseph Fourier, any wave can be treated as one or more <em class="Defn">harmonic</em> (sine-shaped) waves that have been added together.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/wave/img/harm.js#tr"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>For <em class="Defn">transverse</em> waves (e.g. light*, waves on a string), the motion of the individual points along the wave is <em>perpendicular</em> to the motion of the wave’s energy (<em class="Defn">phase velocity</em>).</li>
    <li>*Light is an electromagnetic wave (see Physics 30!) not a mechanical wave; it does not require a medium.</li>
    <li>Points “above” equilibrium are called <em class="Defn">crests</em> and points “below” equilibrium are <em class="Defn">troughs</em>.</li>
    <li>For <em class="Defn">longitudinal</em> waves (e.g. sound) the particle motion is <em>parallel</em> to the phase velocity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/wave/img/harm.js#long"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Compressions</em> occur where the particles are closer together than normal and <em class="Defn">rarefactions</em> are when the particles are more spread out.</li>
    <li>Some waves (e.g. surface waves on water) have <em>both</em> transverse and longitudinal components.</li>
    <li>The distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves (e.g. crest-to-crest) is called the <em class="Defn">wavelength</em>, <span class="TeX">\lambda</span>.</li>
    <li>Harmonic waves also have an amplitude, period, and frequency, which have the same meaning as for SHM.</li>
    <li>The phase speed of a wave can be calculated as: <p class="TeX">v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Doppler Effect</em> is a phenomenon where the observed frequency of waves is different than the actual frequency of the source when the source and observer are in relative motion:</p>
<p class="TeX">f_o=\frac{v-v_o}{v-v_s}f_s</p>
<p class="Center">

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Waves are closer together — the observed frequency is higher — when the source is approaching the observer.</li>
    <li>Waves are farther apart — the observed frequency is lower — when the source is receding from the observer.</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Interference</em> occurs when two waves overlap in the same place at the same time.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Constructive</em> interference means that two similar parts (e.g. two crests) overlap to produce a bigger wave.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Destructive</em> interference means that two dissimilar parts (e.g. one crest and one trough) overlap to produce a smaller wave.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">beat pattern</em> occurs when two waves of slightly different frequency move in and out of phase, resulting in alternating constructive and destructive interference with a beat frequency:
        <p class="TeX">f_{beat}=\left|f_1-f_2\right|</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Center">
    <iframe data-aspect="16/9" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mxz4fqxcwz?embed" width="640" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>
</p>
<p class="Caption Center">The beat pattern (purple) is produced when the two overlapping waves are added.</p>

<p><em class="Defn">Standing Waves</em> are produced when a wave moving on a <em>finite medium</em> interferes with its own reflections.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When the end of the medium is fixed, the interference there must be destructive, and a <em class="Defn">node</em> will be produced.</li>
    <li>Only certain harmonics (or resonant frequencies) can have nodes at both ends (e.g. stringed instruments or air columns open at both ends):
        <p class="TeX">f_n=\frac{nv}{2L}</p></li>
    <li>The illustration below shows the third harmonic. (<span class="TeX">n = 3</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="Center"><svg class="s24" id="StandingWave" data-svg2="p20/wave/img/stand.js#stand" data-harmonic="3"></svg></p>
<ul>
    <li>The first harmonic (<span class="TeX">n = 1</span>) is sometimes called the <em class="Defn">fundamental</em> frequency.</li>
    <li>At a free end, the interference will be constructive, and an <em class="Defn">anti-node</em> will occur.</li>
    <li>When one end is a node and the other an anti-node (e.g. an air column closed at only one end), only <em>odd-numbered</em> harmonics will occur:
        <p class="TeX">f_n=\frac{nv}{4L}</p></li>
</ul>
