<section class="Slide"><h3>Force</h3>
<p>A force is an <em>interaction</em> between two objects.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you push on an object (action), the object pushes back on you (reaction).</li>
</ul>
<p>Newton observed that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the action and reaction always occur together,</li>
    <li>they are equal in magnitude,</li>
    <li>they act in opposite directions.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p><em class="Defn">Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</em>: For every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction force:</p>

	<li>When you climb a rope, you cause the rope to exert an upward force on you by exerting a downward force on the rope.</li>
	<li>Jet and rocket propulsion work by forcing gas out the “back” of the engine, causing the gas to propel the vessel forward.</li>

    <li>Since Earth exerts a gravitational force on you, you must exert an equal gravitational force on the Earth!</li>

<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">In a game of billiards, a cue ball with a mass of 300 grams is moving at 5.00 m/s when it collides head on with a stationary ball of mass 250 g. The balls are in contact with each other for 0.200 seconds, after which the cue ball’s velocity is 2.00 m/s.</p>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">a) How much force did the cue ball experience?</p>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/n3.js#pool" class="s16"></svg></p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf v}_f - \vec{\bf v}_i}{\Delta t} = \rm \frac{+2.00\ m/s - 5.00\ m/s}{0.200\ s} = -15.0\ m/s^2</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = m\vec{\bf a} = \rm 0.300\ kg\cdot (-15.0\ m/s^2) = -4.50\ N</p>
<p class="Blue">b) What was the second ball’s velocity after the collision?</p>
<p>According to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, the second ball experienced a force of +4.50 newtons...</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}}{m} = \rm \frac{+4.50\ N}{0.250\ kg} = +18.0\ m/s^2</p>
<p>To find the final velocity, solve one of the uniform accelerated motion equations...</p>
<p class="TeX">\begin{align}\vec{\bf v}_f &= \vec{\bf a}\Delta t + \vec{\bf v}_i
\\[6pt] &= \rm{{+18.0\ m/s^2\cdot 0.200\ s + 0.00\ m/s}}
\\[6pt] &= \rm{+3.60\ m/s}\end{align}</p>

    <li>Since Earth exerts a gravitational force on your desk, does your desk exert a gravitational force on the Earth?  Why is it easier to observe the effects of the action force (Earth pulling on the desk) than the reaction force (desk pulling on Earth)?</li>
    <p class="Answer">According to Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law, the Earth and the desk exert equal and opposite forces on each other. The desk’s gravity has negligible effect on the Earth because the Earth’s mass is <b><u>WAY</u></b> bigger.</p>

    <li>A 53.2 kg student standing on an icy sidewalk leans against a lamppost, exerting a force of 60.0 N on the post.<ol type="a">
        <li>Draw a free body diagram for the student and for the lamppost.</li>
        <li>What is the student’s acceleration?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>The force on the student is the negative of the force he or she exerts on the lamppost...</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}}{m} = \rm{\frac{-60.0\ N}{53.2\ kg} = -1.13\ m/s^2}</p></div>
    
        <li>Why does the lamppost not accelerate even though the student is exerting a force on it?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The lamppost is attached to the ground. The ground exerts enough force to balance the force applied by the student.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li>An archer shoots a 318 g arrow from her bow. The bowstring accelerates the arrow to a final velocity of 34.0 m/s over 82.5 cm.<ol type="a">
        <li>Determine the acceleration and force experienced by the arrow.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Use the uniform accelerated motion equations to find the acceleration...</p>
            <p class="TeX">\begin{align}
\vec{\bf a} &= \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2\Delta\vec{\bf d}}
\\[10pt] &= \rm{\frac{(34.0\ m/s)^2 - (0.00\ m/s)^2}{2\cdot 0.825\ m}}
\\[10pt] &= \rm{+701\ m/s^2}\end{align}</p>
            <p>Now use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law to find the force...</p>

\vec{\bf F} &= m\vec{\bf a}

        <li>What recoil force does the archer experience through the bow?</li>
        <p class="Answer">According to Newton’s 3rd Law, the archer experiences a recoil of –223 N.</p>

        <li>If the 59.1 kg archer shoots while standing on a perfectly frictionless surface, what would her acceleration be?</li>
        <p class="TeX Answer">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}}{m} = \rm{\frac{-223\ N}{59.1\ kg} = -3.77\ m/s^2}</p>

        <li>Why does the archer not accelerate when she shoots while standing on grass, dirt or concrete?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The friction produced by the ground would balance the recoil applied by the bow.</p>

    <li>A 1.45 × 10<sup>4</sup> kg bus and a 1.07 × 10<sup>3</sup> kg car moving in the opposite direction collide head-on. The bus “decelerates” at 12.0 m/s<sup>2</sup> during the collision.<ol type="a">
        <li>Draw a free body diagram for the bus and for the car.</li>
        <li>What is the car’s acceleration?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>First find the net force acting on the bus...</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = m\vec{\bf a} = \rm{1.45\times 10^4\ kg\cdot (-12.0\ m/s^2) = -1.74\times 10^5\ N}</p>
            <p>The force acting on the car is <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = \rm{+1.74\times 10^5\ N}</span> according to Newton’s 3rd Law. For the car...</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}}{m} = \rm{\frac{+1.74\times 10^5\ N}{1.07\times 10^3\ kg} = +163\ m/s^2}</p>

        <li>Explain why seatbelts are mandatory in cars while many busses are not equipped with seatbelts.</li>
        <p class="Answer">During a collision, passengers in a more massive vehicle will experience less acceleration than those in a smaller vehicle. The risk of injury is greater for those in the lighter vehicle.</p>

    <li>An asteroid at rest explodes into two pieces.  During the explosion, the two fragments exert forces on each other over a time interval of 0.750 s.  One piece has a mass of 1240 kg and a velocity of 523 m/s after the explosion. Determine the force that the pieces exert on each other and the final velocity of the second fragment, which has a mass of 874 kg.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Calculate the acceleration and force on the 1240 kg object...</p>
        <p class="TeX">\begin{align}
    \vec{\bf a} &= \frac{\vec{\bf v}_f - \vec{\bf v}_i}{\Delta t}
