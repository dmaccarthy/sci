<section class="Slide"><h3>Contact Forces</h3>
<p>When two solid objects are in <em>contact with</em> each other, they exert a normal force and a friction force on each other.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li>The <em class="Defn">normal force</em> acts <em>perpendicular</em> to the surface of contact and pushes the objects apart.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The <em class="Defn">friction force</em> acts <em>parallel</em> to the surface to oppose any relative motion between the objects.</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="+">Observations have lead scientists to conclude that the maximum force of friction often depends directly on the normal force.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li>Doubling the normal force will double the force of friction as well.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">For example, if you push down on object, that increases the normal force and makes it harder to drag the object horizontally because friction will increase in proportion to the normal force.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">This observation is written in the form of an equation:<p class="TeX">|{\vec{\mathbf F}}_f| = \mu |{\vec{\mathbf F}}_n|</p></li>
	<li data-cue="+">This is a <em>scalar</em> equation; do not include directions with the forces!</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The symbol <span class="TeX">\mu</span> is called the <em class="Defn">coefficient of friction</em>.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">It is simply the <em>ratio</em> of the friction force to the normal force.
    <p class="TeX">\mu = {|{\vec{\mathbf F}}_f|\over |{\vec{\mathbf F}}_n|}</p></li>
	<li data-cue="+">A coefficient of 0.40 means that the friction force is 40% as strong as the normal force.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">A smaller value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> indicates a “slippery” surface (not much friction).</li>
	<li data-cue="+">A larger value indicates a rougher surface with more friction.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Static &amp; Kinetic Friction</h3>
<p data-cue="+">The value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> does not depend much on how fast the object is sliding along the surface, but it does depend on whether the object is stationary or moving.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
	<li>The value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> when the object is stationary is called the coefficient of <em class="Defn">static friction</em> <span class="TeX">(\mu_s)</span> and its value when the object is moving is the coefficient of <em class="Defn">kinetic friction</em> <span class="TeX">(\mu_k)</span>.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">In most cases, <span class="TeX">\mu_s > \mu_k</span>, meaning the maximum friction acting on the stationary object will be greater than when the object is moving.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example</h3>
<p class="Blue">A 2.00-kilogram book rests on a horizontal surface that has a coefficient of static friction of 0.400 and kinetic friction of 0.340. How much force must be applied to make the book start moving?</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = {\mathrm{2.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 19.6\ N}}</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">F_f = \mu_s F_n = {\mathrm{0.400\cdot 19.6\ N = 7.85\ N}}</p>
<p data-cue="+">The applied force must exceed 7.85 newtons to ovecome the friction.</p>
<p class="Blue" data-cue="+">What will be the book’s acceleration when the applied force is 10.0 newtons?</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">F_f = \mu_k F_n = {\mathrm{0.340\cdot 19.6\ N = 6.67\ N}}</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">{\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} = {\vec{\mathbf F}}_a + {\vec{\mathbf F}}_f = {\mathrm{+10.0\ N + (-6.67\ N) = +3.33\ N}}</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">{\vec{\mathbf a}} = {{\vec{\mathbf F}}_{net} \over m} = {\mathrm{{+3.33\ N\over 2.00\ kg} = +1.67\ m/s^2}}</p>

    <li>The coefficient of kinetic friction between a table and a moving 4.00 kg wooden block is 0.270. Draw and label a free body diagram. Determine the force of friction acting on the block.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="Answer Center"><svg data-js="p20/dyn/img/fbd#fbd" class="VDiag"></svg></p>
        <p>The normal and gravity forces are balanced:
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \mathrm{4.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 39.2\ N}</p>
Solve for friction:
<p class="TeX">F_f = \mu_kF_n = \mathrm{0.270\cdot 39.2\ N = 10.6\ N}</p>
We cannot solve for the block’s acceleration unless the applied force is given.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Determine the acceleration of a 50.0 kg chair being dragged horizontally by an applied force of 280 N. The coefficient of friction between the chair and the floor is 0.400. Include a labelled free body diagram.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The FBD is the same as for as #1. Since the motion is horizontal, the vertical forces (normal and gravity) balance:
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \mathrm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 491\ N}</p>
The friction force is 40% of the normal force:
<p class="TeX">F_f = \mu_kF_n = \mathrm{0.400\cdot 491\ N = 196\ N}</p>
The direction of friction must oppose the motion, therefore...
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf F}_f = \mathrm{-196\ N}</p>
The net force is the sum of the unbalanced forces (applied and friction):
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf F}_{net} = \vec{\mathbf F}_a + \vec{\mathbf F}_f = \mathrm{+280\ N + (-196\ N) = +83.8\ N}</p>
Use Newton’s 2nd Law:
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{\vec{\mathbf F}_{net}}{m} = \mathrm{\frac{+83.8\ N}{50.0 kg} = +1.68\ m/s^2}</p></div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>An applied force of 65.0 N is required to keep a 14.0 kg object moving with constant velocity (i.e. <span class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf{a}}</span> = 0!) along the floor. Calculate the coefficient of kinetic friction between the object and floor.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Since the motion is horizontal, the vertical forces (normal and gravity) balance:
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \mathrm{14.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 137\ N}</p>
Since the acceleration is zero, the net force must be zero according to Newton’s Laws, and thus the friction force must balance the applied force:
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf F}_f = -\vec{\mathbf F}_a = \mathrm{-65.0\ N}</p>
Do not include the directions when calculating the coefficient of friction...
<p class="TeX">\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \mathrm{\frac{65.0\ N}{137\ N} = 0.473}</p></div>

        <li>If the object is allowed to come to rest, it takes 82.0 N of applied force to start the object moving again. Calculate the coefficient of static friction.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The solution is identical to (a) except that the balanced applied and friction forces are both 82.0 N rather than 65.0 N:
<p class="TeX">\mu_s = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \mathrm{\frac{82.0\ N}{137\ N} = 0.597}</p>

        <li>A textbook is slid across the floor with an initial velocity of 2.60 m/s. Once the person stops pushing the book (<span class="TeX">{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_a</span> = 0!), it comes to rest after 1.72 m. Calculate the acceleration of the textbook.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2\vec{\mathbf a}\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2 \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}
    = \mathrm{\frac{(0.00\ m/s)^2 - (2.60\ m/s)^2}{2\cdot 1.72\ m}}
    = \mathrm{-1.97\ m/s^2}</p>
        </div>

        <li>If the mass of the textbook is 1.50 kg, what is the coefficient of friction?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \mathrm{1.50\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 14.7\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">F_f = F_{net} = ma = \mathrm{1.50\ kg\cdot 1.97\ m/s^2 = 2.95\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \mathrm{\frac{2.95\ N}{14.7\ N} = 0.200}</p>
        </div>

        <li>Repeat (b) for a mass of 2.50 kg.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \mathrm{2.50\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 24.5\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">F_f = F_{net} = ma = \mathrm{2.50\ kg\cdot 1.97\ m/s^2 = 4.91\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \mathrm{\frac{4.91\ N}{24.5\ N} = 0.200}</p>
        </div>

        <li>Does the mass of the book seem to make any difference to the answer when the applied force is zero? Explain. If the applied force had not been zero, would the mass matter?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \frac{ma}{mg} = \frac{a}{g}</p>
The mass does <em>not</em> matter because it cancels. If there was an applied force, the net force would no longer be just the friction force and the mass <em>would</em> affect the answer!

        <li>A puck is shot along the ice with a speed of 3.50 m/s. If the coefficient of friction between the puck and ice is 0.020, determine the acceleration of the puck. [Recall from the previous question that the mass of the puck does not matter!]</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">\begin{align}

The direction of the acceleration is opposite to the motion.

    <li>A puck sliding along the ice at 4.75 m/s comes to a stop over 42.0 m. Determine the coefficient of kinetic friction between the puck and ice.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2\vec{\mathbf a}\cdot\Delta\vec{\mathbf d}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf a} = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2 \Delta\vec{\mathbf d}}
    = \mathrm{\frac{(0.00\ m/s)^2 - (4.75\ m/s)^2}{2\cdot 42.0\ m}}
    = \mathrm{-0.269\ m/s^2}</p>
Since there is no applied force, the acceleration is caused solely by friction as in #5a:
<p class="TeX">\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_n} = \frac{ma}{mg}= \frac{a}{g} = \mathrm{\frac{0.269\ m/s^2}{9.81\ m/s^2} = 0.0274}</p>
