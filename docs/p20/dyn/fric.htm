<section class="Slide"><h3>Contact Forces</h3>
<p>When two solid objects are in <em>contact with</em> each other, they exert a normal force and a friction force on each other.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <em class="Defn">normal force</em> acts <em>perpendicular</em> to the surface of contact and pushes the objects apart.</li>
	<li>The <em class="Defn">friction force</em> acts <em>parallel</em> to the surface to oppose any relative motion between the objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observations have lead scientists to conclude that the maximum force of friction often depends directly on the normal force.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Doubling the normal force will double the force of friction as well.</li>
	<li>For example, if you push down on object, that increases the normal force and makes it harder to drag the object horizontally because friction will increase in proportion to the normal force.</li>
	<li>This observation is written in the form of an equation:<p class="TeX">|{\vec{\bf F}}_f| = \mu |{\vec{\bf F}}_n|</p></li>
	<li>This is a <em>scalar</em> equation; do not include directions with the forces!</li>
	<li>The symbol <span class="TeX">\mu</span> is called the <em class="Defn">coefficient of friction</em>.</li>
	<li>It is simply the <em>ratio</em> of the friction force to the normal force.
    <p class="TeX">\mu = {|{\vec{\bf F}}_f|\over |{\vec{\bf F}}_n|}</p></li>
	<li>A coefficient of 0.40 means that the friction force is 40% as strong as the normal force.</li>
	<li>A smaller value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> indicates a “slippery” surface (not much friction).</li>
	<li>A larger value indicates a rougher surface with more friction.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Static &amp; Kinetic Friction</h3>
<p>The value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> does not depend much on how fast the object is sliding along the surface, but it does depend on whether the object is stationary or moving.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The value of <span class="TeX">\mu</span> when the object is stationary is called the coefficient of <em class="Defn">static friction</em> <span class="TeX">(\mu_s)</span> and its value when the object is moving is the coefficient of <em class="Defn">kinetic friction</em> <span class="TeX">(\mu_k)</span>.</li>
	<li>In most cases, <span class="TeX">\mu_s > \mu_k</span>, meaning the maximum friction acting on the stationary object will be greater than when the object is moving.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 2.00-kilogram book rests on a horizontal surface that has a coefficient of static friction of 0.400 and kinetic friction of 0.340. How much force must be applied to make the book start moving?</p>
<p class="Center"><svg class="s12" data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/fbd.js#fbd"></svg></p>

<p class="TeX">F_f = \mu_s F_n = {\rm{0.400\cdot 19.6\ N = 7.85\ N}}</p>
<p>The applied force must exceed 7.85 newtons to ovecome the friction.</p>
<p class="Blue">What will be the book’s acceleration when the applied force is 10.0 newtons?</p>
<p class="TeX">F_f = \mu_k F_n = {\rm{0.340\cdot 19.6\ N = 6.67\ N}}</p>

        <p>The normal and gravity forces are balanced:</p>

    <li>Determine the acceleration of a 50.0 kg chair being dragged horizontally by an applied force of 280 N. The coefficient of friction between the chair and the floor is 0.400. Include a labelled free body diagram.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The FBD is the same as for as #1. Since the motion is horizontal, the vertical forces (normal and gravity) balance:</p>
        <p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg = \rm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 491\ N}</p>
        <p>The friction force is 40% of the normal force:</p>
        <p class="TeX">F_f = \mu_kF_n = \rm{0.400\cdot 491\ N = 196\ N}</p>
        <p>The direction of friction must oppose the motion, therefore...</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_f = \rm{-196\ N}</p>
        <p>The net force is the sum of the unbalanced forces (applied and friction):</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = \vec{\bf F}_a + \vec{\bf F}_f = \rm{+280\ N + (-196\ N) = +83.8\ N}</p>
        <p>Use Newton’s 2nd Law:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{\vec{\bf F}_{net}}{m} = \rm{\frac{+83.8\ N}{50.0 kg} = +1.68\ m/s^2}</p>

        <li>An applied force of 65.0 N is required to keep a 14.0 kg object moving with constant velocity (i.e. <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf{a}}</span> = 0!) along the floor. Calculate the coefficient of kinetic friction between the object and floor.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Since the motion is horizontal, the vertical forces (normal and gravity) balance:</p>

            <p>Since the acceleration is zero, the net force must be zero according to Newton’s Laws, and thus the friction force must balance the applied force:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_f = -\vec{\bf F}_a = \rm{-65.0\ N}</p>

            <p>The solution is identical to (a) except that the balanced applied and friction forces are both 82.0 N rather than 65.0 N:</p>

        <li>Does the mass of the book seem to make any difference to the answer when the applied force is zero? Explain. If the applied force had not been zero, would the mass matter?</li>

        <li>Why are the <em class="Defn">friction</em> and <em class="Defn">normal</em> forces described as <em class="Defn">contact forces</em>?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Both of these force are created by the contact between the object and the surface upon which it rests. When there is no surface (e.g. for an airborn object) there is no normal or friction force.</p>
    
        <li>How are the friction and normal forces similar and how are they different?</li>
        <p class="Answer">This forces are both exerted by the surface and they are proportional to each other. They are perpendicular to each other, with the normal force pushing the object <em>away</em> and the friction acting in the <em>opposite</em> direction to the motion.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What factors affect how strong the friction force is?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The force of friction is proportional to both the coefficient of friction (<span class="TeX">\mu</span>) and the normal force. The coefficient of friction depends on whether there is motion between the object and surface (kinetic friction) or whether the object is it rest relative to the surface (static friction).</p>
    
        <li>Write the relationship (equation) between the friction and normal forces.</li>
        <p class="TeX Answer">\mu = \frac{F_f}{F_n}</p>

        <li>Explain the difference between <em class="Defn">static</em> and <em class="Defn">kinetic</em> friction.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Kinetic friction describes frictrion when the object is sliding along the surface, while static friction is the maximum amount of force that friction  can provided when the object is at rest on the surface.</p>
    
        <li>Explain the difference between the <em>force</em> of friction and the <em class="Defn">coefficient of friction</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">The <em>force</em> is measured in newtons, and is used (along with all other forces) to calculate the acceleration according to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law. The <em>coefficent</em> is a ratio describing how strong friction is relative to the normal force.</p>
