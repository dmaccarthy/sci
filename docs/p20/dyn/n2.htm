<h1 id="Title">Forces &amp; Inertia</h1>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Inertia (Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law)</h3>
<p>If you stop pushing on an object, it will begin to slow and eventually come to rest.</p>
<ul>
	<li>How long it takes to come to rest depends on how much friction and air resistance are present, since these are the forces responsible for transforming the kinetic energy into other energy forms.</li>
	<li>If there were no forces acting on the object at all — including no friction or air resistance — the object would continue to move <em>forever</em> with a <em>constant velocity</em>, since its kinetic energy would not change.</li>
	<li>Since there is no air resistance outside the atmosphere, objects in space (planets, asteroids, comets) move without slowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tendency of objects to move with constant velocity is called <em class="Defn">inertia</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Law of Inertia was first stated by Galileo in the early 1600’s, before the Law of Energy Conservation had even been discovered.</li>
	<li>When he wrote his book on motion, Newton adopted the Law of Inertia as his first law of motion</em>...</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</em>: Objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion tend to remain in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</li>
    <li>In other words, <em>uniform motion</em> is the natural state of motion for objects when they are not interacting with other objects.</li></ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Force (Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law)</h3>
<p>On their own, objects move in uniform motion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To make an object <em>accelerate</em> (speed up, slow down, or change direction) requires a <em class="Defn">force</em>.</li>
	<li>An object’s <em>mass</em> determines its inertia; larger masses are more difficult to accelerate.</li>
    <!-- <li>The work-energy theorem was one way to describe the effect a force has on the motion of an object:
        <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = W = \vec{\bf F}_\parallel \cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</p>
    </li> -->
    <li><em class="Defn">Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</em> describes the effect of force on motion in terms of acceleration:
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\vec{\bf a}</p>
    </li>
	<li>The SI unit of force is the newton: <span class="TeX">\rm{N = kg\cdot m/s^2}</span>.</li>
	<li>If more than one force acts on the object, <span class="TeX">{\vec{\bf F}}_{net}</span> is the vector sum of all the individual forces.</li>
    <li>The net or total force is also called the <em class="Defn">unbalanced force</em> or the <em class="Defn">resultant force</em>.</li>
    <!-- <li>The work-energy theorem equation can be derived by combining Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law with the uniform accelerated motion equations:
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\frac{\vec{\bf v}_f - \vec{\bf v}_i}{\Delta t}</p>
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \frac{\vec{\bf v}_i + \vec{\bf v}_f}{2} \Delta t</p>
    </li> -->
</ul>
<p>Some common forces are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Gravity</em>: An attractive force between masses.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Elastic</em>: Exerted by a stretched or compressed object trying to return to its original shape (bow, spring, bungee).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Tension</em>: Exerted by an object that does not stretch (rope, rod).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Normal</em>: Exerted by a surface (ground, floor, table) on an object in contact; acts perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Friction</em>: Exerted by a surface on an object opposite to the motion; acts parallel to the surface.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Air Resistance</em>: Exerted by air (or other gases) on objects moving through.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Applied</em>: Exerted by a person, animal, or machine.</li>
    <li>Others: <em class="Defn">Buoyancy</em>, <em class="Defn">Electric</em>, <em class="Defn">Magnetic</em>, <em class="Defn">Nuclear</em></li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">How much force is needed to make a 2.00-kilogram textbook accelerate at 4.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>?</p>
<p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf F}}_{net} = m{\vec{\bf a}} = \rm{2.00\ kg \cdot 4.00\ m/s^2 = 8.00\ N}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">What is the acceleration of a 25.0 kg child being pushed on a swing when the net force is 90.0 N?</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Free Body Diagrams</h3>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/fbd.js#fbd1" class="s10"></svg></p>
<p>A <em class="Defn">free body diagram</em> is an illustration that shows the forces acting on an object.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Each force is drawn as a <em>vector</em> pointing in the direction that the force acts.</li>
	<li>The length of each vector illustrates how strong the force is.</li>
	<li>For a mass on a ramp, the forces are:
        <ul>
            <li>gravitational force pulling down</li>
            <li>normal force pushing perpendicular to the ramp</li>
            <li>friction parallel to the ramp, opposite to the motion</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Free body diagrams are used to clarify the interactions that an object is experiencing, in order to determine the object’s acceleration.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Vector Diagrams</h3>
<p>A free body diagram should not be confused with a <em class="Defn">vector diagram</em>.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/fbd.js#vec1" class="s10"></svg></p>
<ul>
	<li>The vector diagram illustrates the same three forces as the free body diagram.</li>
	<li>The main difference is that the arrows representing the force vectors have been redrawn “tip-to-tail” to show the resultant (net) force.</li>
	<li>Vector diagram are drawn exactly the same for forces as for displacement.</li>
	<li>For an object moving <em>horizontally</em>, the <em>vertical</em> forces must balance and the net force will be the total of the horizontal forces.</li>
	<li>For an object moving <em>vertically</em>, the <em>horizontal</em> forces must balance and the net force will be the total of the vertical forces.</li>
</ul>
