</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Inertia</h3>
<p>If you stop pushing on an object, it will begin to slow and eventually come to rest.</p>
<ul>
	<li>How long it takes to come to rest depends on how much friction and air resistance are present, since these are the forces responsible for transforming the kinetic energy into other energy forms.</li>
	<li>If there were no forces acting on the object at all — including no friction or air resistance — the object would continue to move <em>forever</em> with a <em>constant velocity</em>, since its kinetic energy would not change.</li>
	<li>Since there is no air resistance outside the atmosphere, objects in space (planets, asteroids, comets) move without slowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tendency of objects to move with constant velocity is called <em class="Defn">inertia</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Law of Inertia was first stated by Galileo in the early 1600’s, before the Law of Energy Conservation had even been discovered.</li>
	<li>When he wrote his book on motion, Newton adopted the Law of Inertia as his first law of motion</em>...</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Newton’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</em>: Objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion tend to remain in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</li>
    <li>In other words, <em>uniform motion</em> is the natural state of motion for objects when they are not interacting with other objects.</li></ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Force</h3>
<p>On their own, objects move in uniform motion.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To make an object <em>accelerate</em> (speed up, slow down, or change direction) requires a <em class="Defn">force</em>.</li>
	<li>An object’s <em>mass</em> determines its inertia; larger masses are more difficult to accelerate.</li>
    <li>The work-energy theorem was one way to describe the effect a force has on the motion of an object:
        <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = W = \vec{\bf F}_\parallel \cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</p>
    </li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</em> describes the effect of force on motion in terms of acceleration:
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\vec{\bf a}</p>
    </li>
	<li>The SI unit of force is the newton: <span class="TeX">\rm{N = kg\cdot m/s^2}</span>.</li>
	<li>If more than one force acts on the object, <span class="TeX">{\vec{\bf F}}_{net}</span> is the vector sum of all the individual forces.</li>
    <li>The net or total force is also called the <em class="Defn">unbalanced force</em> or the <em class="Defn">resultant force</em>.</li>
    <li>The work-energy theorem equation can be derived by combining Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law with the uniform accelerated motion equations:
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\frac{\vec{\bf v}_f - \vec{\bf v}_i}{\Delta t}</p>
        <p data-cue="none" class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \frac{\vec{\bf v}_i + \vec{\bf v}_f}{2} \Delta t</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Some common forces are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Gravity</em>: An attractive force between masses.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Elastic</em>: Exerted by a stretched or compressed object trying to return to its original shape (bow, spring, bungee).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Tension</em>: Exerted by an object that does not stretch (rope, rod).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Normal</em>: Exerted by a surface (ground, floor, table) on an object in contact; acts perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Friction</em>: Exerted by a surface on an object opposite to the motion; acts parallel to the surface.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Air Resistance</em>: Exerted by air (or other gases) on objects moving through.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Applied</em>: Exerted by a person, animal, or machine.</li>
    <li>Others: <em class="Defn">Buoyancy</em>, <em class="Defn">Electric</em>, <em class="Defn">Magnetic</em>, <em class="Defn">Nuclear</em></li>
</ul>

    <p class="Answer">Objects at rest will remain at rest and <em>objects in motion will remain in motion with a constant velocity</em> unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Once an object is set in motion it does <b>not</b> require a force to keep the object in motion!</p>

    <div class="Answer">
        <p>When there is an unbalanced force acting on an object, the object will accelerate accordingto the equation:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\vec{\bf a}</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Is force a scalar or vector?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Vector; it has a direction.</p>
    
        <li>What is the SI unit of force? How is this unit defined?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>A <b>newton</b> is the amount of force needed to make a 1-kilogram mass accelerate at 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>:</p>
            <p class="TeX">\rm{N = kg\cdot\frac{m}{s^2}}</p>

    <li>Based on Newton’s Laws of Motion, what are the requirements for (a) uniform motion, and (b) uniform accelerated motion?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Uniform motion occurs when the net (unbalanced) force is exactly <em>zero</em>. Uniform accelerated motion occurs when there is a <em>constant</em>, non-zero unbalanced force.</p>
