<p><em class="Defn">Gravitational Force</em> is a “universal” phenomenon that exists between all masses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In a uniform gravitational field (for example near Earth’s surface) all test objects experience the same acceleration when gravity is the only force, regardless of their mass.</li>
    <li>The acceleration due to gravity is called <span class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf g}</span> and has a magnitude of about <span class="TeX">\mathrm{9.81 m/s^2}</span> on Earth.</li>
    <li>More generally, we can calculate <span class="TeX">g</span> (due to a <em class="Defn">source</em> <span class="TeX">M</span> at a separation <span class="TeX">r</span>) using <em class="Defn">Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation</em>:
        <p class="TeX">g=\frac{GM}{r^2}</p>
</ul>

<p>The force of gravity (also called <em class="Defn">weight</em>) is related to the <em class="Defn">test mass</em> (the object experiencing the force) as:
<p class="TeX">{\vec{\mathbf{F}}}_g=m\vec{\mathbf{g}}</p></p>
<ul>
    <li>By combining the two equations, the gravitational force that any two masses separated by <span class="TeX">r</span> exert on each other is:
        <p class="TeX">F_g=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em class="Defn">Cavendish’s torsion balance experiment</em> determined the value of the <em class="Defn">universal gravitational constant</em> to be:</p>
<p class="TeX">G = \mathrm{6.67 \times 10^{-11}\ \frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}}</p>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>A torsion balance measures force (responding variable) by balancing the force trying to twist the apparatus (i.e. gravity) with the wire or spring’s tendency to untwist itself.</li>
    <li>Cavendish manipulated the separation between masses while controlling the masses themselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is an <em class="Defn">inverse square law</em>, which means that when the separation increases by a factor of 2, for example, the gravitational force weakens by a factor of 4.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The concept of <em class="Defn">action at a distance</em> implies that masses can somehow reach out over large distances to instantaneously exert force on each other.</li>
    <li>By contrast, the idea of a <em class="Defn">gravitational field</em> is that each mass affects the space surrounding it and moves within the combined field of all other masses, similar to the way that the shape of a trampoline <em class="Defn">mediates</em> the motion of objects placed upon it.</li>
    <li>The field concept implies that changes in the gravitational field can propagate like waves, and the effects will be delayed in proportion to how far away the observer is.</li>
    <li>A gravitational field can be visualized by drawing <em class="Defn">equipotentials</em> (<span class="TeX">E_g</span>) and/or <em class="Defn">gravitational field lines</em> (<span class="TeX">\vec{\mathbf g}</span>). The field lines will always cross the equipotentials at exactly 90°.</li>
    <li>Where the field is stronger, the field lines and equipotentials will be closer together.</li>
    <li>Each field line converges to one of the sources producing the field.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <em class="Defn">circular orbits</em> around a star or planet, we can set the centripetal acceleration of the orbiting object equal to the source’s gravitational field:
    <p class="TeX">a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2} = g = \frac{GM}{r^2} </p></p>
<ul>
    <li>This is only true when there are no other forces, including thrust, air resistance, and gravity due to other sources.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">geosynchronous</em> orbit has a period equal to the planet’s rotation.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">geostationary</em> orbit is a circular, geosynchronous orbit above the planet’s equator; the satellite maintains a fixed position relative to the ground.</li>
    <li>Geostationary satellites are useful for communication, because ground-based receivers (satellite dishes) will not need to track the satellite’s motion unless the receiver is moved.</li>
</ul>
