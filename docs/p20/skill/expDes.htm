    <li>Science 10 students conducted an experiment about heat capacity.
        The students added a 50-gram metal block at 20 °C to a beaker of water that had been heated to 80 °C.
        They waited 2 minutes to allow the system to come to equilibrium and then measured the final temperature of the water.
        They repeated these measurements several times using different amounts of water each time but keeping all other measurements the same.
        Identify the:

            <div class="Answer">initial temperatures of block and water, mass of block, waiting time</div>
        </ol></li>
    <li>What does it mean to “control the variables” and why is that important when designing an experiment?</li>
    <div class="Answer">This means that all independentent variables are kept constant except for the one we are interested in (manipulated).
        This is necessary for us to be confident that the manipulated variable is the cause of the results we observe.</div>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Independent Variables</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Experimental variables</em> are quantities that can (in principle) be measured as part of an experiment.</p>

<p data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Independent variables</em> are varibles that the experimenter can specify directly, in advance of doing the experiment.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>For example, if you were doing an experiment to study a simple pendulum, you could construct the pendulum so that its
    length was 1.00 metre.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The pendulum length is an independent variable.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Dependent Variables</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Dependent variables</em> are variables that cannot be specified in advance, because they <em>depend on</em> the independent ones.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The time it takes the pendulum to complete a swing is a dependent variable, because it depends on the length of the pendulum.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Changing the length of the pendulum will affect the swing time.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">There can be multiple independent variables (e.g. the length and mass of the pendulum, and the strength of gravity) that might affect the dependent variable.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>A <em class="Defn">hypothesis</em> is a <em>prediction</em> about how changes in one of the independent variables will
    affect one of the dependent variables.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Example: As the length of a simple pendulum is increased, the time it takes the pendulum to complete one swing will also increase.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">If possible, our prediction should include the expected mathematical relationship (i.e. an equation) between the
    variables.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The independent variable that the hypothesis refers to (e.g. length) is called the <em class="Defn">manipulated</em>
    variable.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The dependent variable in the hypothesis (e.g. time) is called the <em class="Defn">responding</em> variable.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Controlled Variables</h3>
<p>Independent variables that are not manipulated (for example, the pendulum’s mass) are called <em class="Defn">controlled variables</em>.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>It is very important that all controlled variables be kept constant during the experiment.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">If we were to change both the length and the mass of the pendulum, there would be no way for us to know if changes in the pendulum’s swing time
    were caused by its length or its mass. Therefore, there’s no way to decide if the hypothesis is valid or not!</li>
    <li data-cue="+">We can never be 100% certain that we’ve controlled every conceivable variable, nor is it possible to repeat an
    experiment using every possible value for every controlled variable.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">As a result, our conclusion should never claim that the experiment “proves” the hypothesis.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Scientific knowledge is always conditional (subject to change)!</li>

<li>Physics students are given an assignment to design an experiment to study the properties of air. Each student is given an airtight graduated cylinder with a rubber lid that can move in or out.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Amy decides to submerge her cylinder in a large container of ice water, which will remain at 0° C until all of the ice melts. She then compresses the air in the cylinder by pushing down on the lid, using a scale to measure the force she exerts. Amy records the volume of air by reading the markings on the graduated cylinder. Identify the variables in this experiment and classify each as manipulated, responding or controlled.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Manipulated: Force (Pressure)<br/>Responding: Volume<br/>Controlled: Temperature; same Graduate Cylinder (Area)</div>

    <li>A second student, Ben, decides to study how the air expands when heated. He submerges his graduated cylinder of air in a water bath that is gradually being heated. As the temperature rises, Ben observes the rubber lid slowly being pushed up the cylinder. Identify and classify the variables.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Manipulated: Temperature<br/>Responding: Volume<br/>Controlled: Force (Pressure); same Graduate Cylinder (Area)</div>

<li>Physics students are investigating the motion of a ball thrown straight up into the air.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Identify and classify the independent and dependent variables that they might measure. Think of as many independent variables as you can, because neglecting even one controlled variable will invalidate the experiment!</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        Independent: Mass, Radius, Material, Gravity, Initial Speed, Initial Angle, Initial Height, Time<br/>
        Dependent: Hang Time, Height, Distance, Speed, Angle
    </div>

    <li>Suggest two hypotheses as to how the variables might be related.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Many different answers are possible! For example: “As the initial speed increases, the height that the ball reaches will increase.”</div>

<li>As a student studying to become a veterinarian, you have been asked to design an experiment on the growth of puppies into adult dogs.

        Independent: Breed, Age, Diet (Amount, Type), Exercise, Health Conditions<br/>
        Dependent: Mass, Height, Length
