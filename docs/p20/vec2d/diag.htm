    <li>Draw an illustration of the player’s motion by drawing the two displacement vectors in a tip-to-tail fashion. You can take the player’s initial position as the origin.

    <li>Why is it essential to use the same scale for both the <span class="TeX">x</span>- and <span class="TeX">y</span>-axes when drawing vector diagrams?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Using different scales will distort the measurements of both angles and magnitudes.</p>

    <li>Explain how to draw a vector diagram for a single vector given (a) the initial and final coordinates, or (b) the magnitude (length) and direction (angle) of the vector.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Given the initial and final coordinates, mark these two points on the diagram, and then connect them with an arrow pointing from initial to final.</p>
        <p>Given the magnitude and direction, hold your protractor with its centre at the starting position (use the origin if not specified!) and the 0° mark parallel to the <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis. Mark the desired direction and lightly sketch a line in that direction from the starting point. Now <em>use the scale of the drawing</em> as labelled on one axis to measure out the desired magnitude. Complete the arrow so it has the desired length.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Explain how to measure (a) the initial and final coordinate, and (b) the magnitude and direction of a vector from a vector diagram.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The initial and final coordinates can be read directly off of the diagram.</p>
        <p>Measure the direction using a protractor centred on the tail of the vector with the 0° mark parallel to the <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis. Measure the length of the vector with a ruler or by marking a piece of paper and then use the scale of the diagram as marked on one axis to see what magnitude that length corresponds to.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Define the <em class="Defn">resultant</em> vector.</li>
    <p class="Answer">The <em>sum</em> of two or more vectors.</p>

    <li>Explain how to draw a vector diagram that illustrates the addition of two or more vectors.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Draw the arrows representing the vectors to be added in a <em><b>tip-to-tail</b></em> fashion. Draw the resultant vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector.</p>
