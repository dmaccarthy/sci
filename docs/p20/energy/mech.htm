<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy</h3>
<p ><em class="Defn">Energy</em> is the ability to produces <em>changes</em> in motion, temperature, or other physical or chemical properties.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Energy comes in many different forms.</li> 
    <li data-cue="+">Energy is a <em>scalar</em> quantity; it has no direction.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Energy is a <em>conserved</em> quantity.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The SI unit of energy is called the <em>joule</em>. A joule can be expressed in terms of simpler units:<p class="TeX">\rm {J = N\cdot m = kg \cdot {m^2\over s^2}}</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>
<p>Motion is itself a form of energy, which we call the <em class="Defn">kinetic energy</em>:</p>
<p class="TeX">E_k = {1 \over 2} mv^2</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>In this equation, <span class="TeX">m</span> is the <em>mass</em> of the object in kilograms.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The symbol <span class="TeX">v</span> is the <em>speed</em> of the object in metres per second (m/s).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Rotational Energy</h3>
    <p>An object that is spinning in place has energy. We call this <em>rotational energy</em>.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>We can use rotational energy to pull or lift an object (e.g. a winch) or to create electricity (e.g. a generator).</li> 
        <li data-cue="+">The equation for rotational energy depends on the shape of the object and whether it is solid or hollow.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">A ball rolling down a ramp has <em>both</em> kinetic and rotational energy.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3><!-- https://freesvg.org/img/mountainclimbing.png -->
    <p>When an object is elevated above the ground, it has energy because gravity will cause the object to move when it is released.</p>
    <div data-cue="+"><p>This type of energy is called <em class="Defn">gravitational potential energy</em>:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_g = mgh</p></div>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>In this equation, <span class="TeX">g</span> is the <em>gravitational field strength</em>. Close to Earth’s surface, <span class="TeX">g = 9.81\ {\rm{m/s^2}}</span>.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The symbol <span class="TeX">h</span> is the <em>height</em> of the object relative to the origin (usually the ground).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">As with kinetic energy, <span class="TeX">m</span> is the mass in kilograms.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">This formula is only valid when the gravitational field is constant and uniform.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Elasticity</em> is a property of objects that return to their original shape when they are stretched or compressed.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Elastic objects include springs, rubber bands, bungees, and archery bows.</li>
    </ul>
    <div data-cue="+"><p>The energy stored in a stretched or compressed elastic is called <em class="Defn">elastic potential energy</em>:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{elas} = {1\over 2}k \left({\Delta L}\right)^2</p></div>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>The variable <span class="TeX">k</span> is called the <em class="Defn">elastic constant</em>. It measures the strength of the elastic object in newtons per metre (N/m).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The variable <span class="TeX">\Delta L</span> is the distance the elastic is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium shape.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Mechanical Forms of Energy</h3>
    <p>Types of energy that are related to the objects’ motion are called <em class="Defn">mechanical</em> forms of energy. Mechanical energy includes:</p>
    <table data-cue="+" class="Normal">
        <tr><td style="width:14em">Kinetic Energy</td><td style="width:10em"><span class="TeX">E_k = {1 \over 2} mv^2</span></td></tr>
        <tr data-cue="+"><td>Gravitational Potential Energy</td><td><span class="TeX">E_g = mgh</span></td></tr>
        <tr data-cue="+"><td>Elastic Potential Energy</td><td><span class="TeX">E_{elas} = {1\over 2}k \left({\Delta L}\right)^2</span></td></tr>
        <tr data-cue="+"><td>Rotational Energy</td><td>Depends on object</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p data-cue="+">Scientists use the term “mechanical energy” to mean the <em>total</em> of <em>all</em> mechanical forms of energy present in a system at a particular instant in time.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Non-Mechanical Forms of Energy</h3>
    <p>There are many different forms of energy that are related to properties other than motion (e.g. temperature or chemical composition).</p>
    <div data-cue="+"><p>Some non-mechanical forms of energy include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thermal energy</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Sound energy</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Electrical energy</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Chemical energy</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Nuclear energy</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Light and other electromagnetic energy</li>
    </ul></div>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Bar Chart</h3>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/energy/img/cons.js#bar" id="Bar" class="EnergyBar s18"></svg></p>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">energy bar chart</em> is a way to keep track of how much of each form of energy is present in a system.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>This graph is for a ball that rolls down a ramp. Initially, it has not started moving, so it only has gravitational potential energy (16.5 joules).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">As the ball rolls down the ramp, energy is transformed and the height of each bar changes. <span class="NoPresent NoPrint">(Click the graph to run the animation.)</span></li>
        <li data-cue="+">The <span class="TeX">E_g</span> bar gets smaller as the ball loses gravitational potential energy.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The <span class="TeX">E_k</span> and <span class="TeX">E_{rotn}</span> bars gets bigger as those forms of energy increase.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The total energy must remain constant; the total of the bars is always 16.5 joules in this example.</li>

    <li>A pinball game uses a spring that is stretched by 12.0 cm to launch a ball (<span class="TeX">m</span> = 75.0 g) to start the game.

Draw energy bar charts for the system before and after launch.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p>After the ball is set in motion, it only has kinetic energy, so the mechanical energy is:

<p class="TeX">2E_{elas} = k(\Delta L)^2</p>
<p class="TeX">k = \frac{2E_{elas}}{(\Delta L)^2}

    <li>A solid metal ball with a mass of 200 grams rolls down a ramp starting from rest. When the ball is halfway down the ramp, its speed is measured to be 2.00 m/s. For a solid sphere that rolls without slipping, the rotational energy equation is: <p class="TeX">E_{rotn}=\frac{1}{5}mv^2</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the ball’s kinetic and rotational energies.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
= \rm{\frac{1}{2} (0.200\ kg) (2.00\ m/s)^2 = 0.400\ J}</p>
<p class="TeX">E_{rotn} = \frac{1}{5}mv^2
= \rm{\frac{1}{5} (0.200\ kg) (2.00\ m/s)^2 = 0.160\ J}</p>
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the ball’s gravitational potential energy and its mechanical energy. Remember that the ball is halfway down the ramp at this point. Assume there is no change in the mechanical energy as the ball rolls. [Before trying to answer this, draw two separate energy bar charts for the system at the (i) top and (ii) halfway point of the hill.]</li>
        <div class="Answer">
Because the ball is at the halfway point, it has half of the gravitational potential energy that it started with; the other half has become kinetic and rotational energy. Thus:
<p class="TeX">E_g = E_k + E_{rotn} = \rm{0.400\ J + 0.160\ J = 0.560\ J}</p>
<p class="TeX">\Sigma E = E_g + E_k + E_{rotn} = \rm{0.560\ J + 0.400\ J + 0.160\ J = 1.12\ J}</p>
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the height from which the ball was released.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">E_g = mgh</p>
<p class="TeX">h = \frac{E_g}{mg}
    = \rm{\frac{1.12\ J}{0.200\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 0.571\ m}</p>

        <div class="Answer">Energy is a scalar, so <span class="TeX">g</span> does not require a direction as it does when using it as an acceleration (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf g}</span>).</div>
