<section class="Slide"><h3>Work in 2D</h3>
    <p>In 1D, the work done by a force is calculated by multiplying the force by the displacement:</p>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">W = \vec{\bf F}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf d}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the force is in the <em>same</em> direction as the motion, the work is positive and the object gains kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>When the force is in the <em>opposite</em> direction as the motion, the work is negative and the object loses kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>When the force is <em>perpendicular</em> to the motion, the effect of the force is to change the <em>direction</em> of the velocity.</li>
        <li>Since a perpendicular force is neither forward nor backwards, the kinetic energy does not change and the work is zero.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the force acts at an <em>angle</em> to the displacement (rather than directly forward or backward) it has vector <em>components</em> in <em>both</em> the parallel and perpendicular directions:</p>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_\parallel = |\vec{\bf F}| \cos\Delta\theta</p>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_\perp = |\vec{\bf F}| \sin\Delta\theta</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In these equations, <span class="TeX">\Delta\theta</span> is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.</li>
        <li>The perpendicular component is responsible for changing the <em>direction</em> of the velocity and does zero work!</li>
        <li>The parallel component does all the work, causing the mass to gain of loses energy.</li>
        <li>When <span class="TeX">\Delta\theta</span> is between 0 and 90°, the work is positive because the force is (partly) forward.</li>
        <li>When <span class="TeX">\Delta\theta</span> is between 90° and 180°, the work is negative because the force is (partly) backward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we use only the parallel component as the force in the 1D equation, we get:</p>
    <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">W = |\vec{\bf F}|\cdot|\Delta\vec{\bf d}|\cos(\Delta\theta)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The absolute value symbols mean that we do not include directions with the force and displacment vectors when using this equation.</li>
        <li>The cosine function will give us the correct sign for the work!</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 2000 kg rail car is hauled by a truck driving on a road parallel to the tracks. The cable connecting the truck to the rail car exerts a force of 1500 newtons <span class="NoWrap">[–30.0°].</span> Because the rail car can only move parallel to the tracks, assume that the track exerts a force that exactly balances the perpendicular component. Find the rail car’s acceleration.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/adv.js#fbd1" class="s20"></svg></p>

<p>We solved this problem previously using Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law. We could have use work and energy instead.</p>
<p>The gravity and normal forces are balanced so they do not affect the motion. The force of the tracks, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_2</span>, is perpendicular to the motion so it does no work. Only the tension in the cable, <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_1</span>, does work.</p>
<p>Because the acceleration will be constant as long as the forces remain constant, we can use any displacement and initial velocity we want; let’s say 1.00 metre and 0.00 m/s.</p>
<p>The work done by the tension force is:</p>
<p class="TeX">W = |\vec{\bf F}_1| \cdot |\Delta\vec{\bf d}| \cos(30.0^\circ) = \rm 1500\ N\cdot 1.00\ m\cos(30.0^\circ) = 1299.0\ J</p>
<p>Since we took the car to be initially at rest, the work is the final kinetic energy. The final speed is:</p>
<p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 1299.0\ J}{2000\ kg}} = 1.1398\ m/s</p>
<p>Now we can use the uniform accelerated motion equations to find the acceleration:</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2\Delta\vec{\bf d}} = \rm{{(1.1398\ m/s)^2 \over 2\cdot 1.00\ m} = +0.650\ m/s^2}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A student pushes a 2.00 kg box from rest, 2.00 metres up an 8.00° frictionless incline, using an applied force of 10.0 newtons parallel to the ramp. Find the acceleration of the box, the normal force, and the speed at the top of the ramp.</p>
<p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/dyn/img/adv.js#fbd3" class="s20"></svg></p>

<p>We solved this problem previously using Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law. It is easier to use work and energy!</p>

<p>Calculate the work done by the applied force:</p>
<p class="TeX">W_a = \vec{\bf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{10.0\ N\cdot 2.00\ m = 20.0\ J}</p>
<p>Next calculate the work done by gravity:</p>
<p class="TeX">F_g = mg = \rm 2.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 19.62\ N</p>
<p class="TeX">W_g = |\vec{\bf F}_g| \cdot |\Delta\vec{\bf d}| \cos(98.0^\circ) = \rm 19.62\ N\cdot 2.00\ m\cos(98.0^\circ) = -5.4612\ J</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could calculate the gravitational potential energy <em>gained</em>, which is just the negative of the work done by gravity:</p>
<p class="TeX">h = \rm{2.00\ m\cdot\sin(8.00^\circ) = 0.27835\ m}</p>
<p class="TeX">\begin{align}E_{gf} &= mgh \\[8pt]&= \rm{2.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 \cdot 0.27835\ m}\\[8pt]&= \rm{5.4612\ J}\end{align}</p>
<p>Then normal force does not do any work because it acts at exactly 90.0° to the displacement!</p>
<p>Because the box was initially at rest, the <em>total</em> work done is equal to the final kinetic energy:</p>
<p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \Sigma W = \rm 20.0\ J -5.4612\ J = 14.539\ J</p>
<p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{2E_k\over m} = \rm{\sqrt{2(14.539\ J)\over 2.00\ kg} = 3.81\ m/s}</p>
<p>Now we can use the uniform accelerated motion equations to find the acceleration:</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a} = \frac{v_f^2 - v_i^2}{2\Delta\vec{\bf d}} = \rm{{(3.81\ m/s)^2 \over 2\cdot 2.00\ m} = 3.64\ m/s^2}</p>
<ul>
    <li>If there had been friction, we would need to account for the negative work done by friction.</li>
    <li>If given the coefficient of friction, we would need to know the normal force before we could calculate the force of friction.</li>
    <li>Since the normal force does <em>not</em> balance gravity on an incline, we would need to use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law, which requires adding the <span class="TeX">y</span>-components of all forces.</li>
    <li>We would then have a choice whether to use work and energy, or Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law to solve for the <span class="TeX">x</span>-motion.</li>
</ul>

        <li>Compare your answers from (a) and (b).</li>
        <p class="Answer">They are negatives of each other! The work done by gravity is the kinetic energy lost, which is balanced by the gravitational potential energy gained.</p>
