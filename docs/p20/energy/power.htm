</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Power</h3>
<p>The <em>rate</em> at which a force does work is called <em class="Defn">power</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Power is a measure of how quickly an energy-transforming device is able to do work:<p class="TeX">P = {\Delta E\over \Delta t}</p></li>
	<li>The unit of power is J/s, which is called watts (W).</li>
	<li>Do not confuse the symbol for the unit W (watts) with the symbol for the variable <i>W</i> (work).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p>Most energy transformations produce unwanted “waste” forms of energy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For example, a light bulb is intended to transform electrical energy into light energy. In reality, a significant fraction of the energy is wasted in the form of heat.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p>Scientists use the concept of <em class="Defn">efficiency</em> to describe the fraction or percentage of the energy input that is transformed into its intended or useful output:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful} \over |\Delta E_{input}|}</p>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>To say that a light bulb is 20% efficient means that 20% of the electrical energy consumed becomes light energy, and the remaining 80% of the energy consumed becomes waste (thermal energy).</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 2000 kg car accelerates from rest to 20.0 m/s. The engine has an efficiency of 32.0% and produces 120 horsepower (1 hp = 746 W).</p>
    <ol data-cue="none" class="Blue" type="a">
        <li>How long does it take the car to reach its final speed if air resistance and friction are ignored?</li>
    </ol>
    <div>
        <p>Calculate the work done by the engine as the change in kinetic energy...</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_{ki} = {1\over 2}mv_i^2 = 0\ {\rm J}</p>
    </div>
    <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = {1\over 2}mv_f^2 = \rm{{1\over 2}(2000\ kg) (20.0\ m/s)^2 = 400000\ J}</p>
    <p class="TeX">W = \Delta E_k = \rm{400000\ J}</p>
    <div>
        <p>Use the power equation to solve for time...</p>
        <p class="TeX">P = {\Delta E \over \Delta t}</p>
    </div>
    <p class="TeX">P\Delta t = \Delta E</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Delta t = {\Delta E\over P} = \rm{{400000\ J\over 89520\ W} = 4.47\ s}</p>
    <ul><li>Realistically, the engine does not operate at its maximum power all the time, so it would almost certainly take longer than calculated!</li></ul>
    <ol class="Blue" type="a" start="2">
        <li>How much chemical energy (gasoline) is used in accelerating the car?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon \Delta E_{input} = \Delta E_{useful}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\Delta E_{input} = {\Delta E_{useful}\over \epsilon} = \rm{{400000\ J\over 0.320} = 1.25\ MJ}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The efficiency is a little under one-third, so a little less than one-third of the 1.25 MJ consumed becomes useful energy (0.40 MJ).</li>
        <li>The remaining 0.85 MJ represents the sound and thermal energy produced by the engine.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>A student running on a treadmill burns 120 kJ of food energy and produces 97.2 kJ of heat. What is the efficiency of the energy transformation?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">\Delta E_{useful} = \Delta E_{input} - \Delta E_{waste} = \rm{120\ kJ - 97.2\ kJ = 22.8\ kJ}</p>
<p class="TeX">\epsilon = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}} = \rm{\frac{22.8\ kJ}{120\ kJ} = 0.190 = 19.0\%}</p>

    <li>How does power relate to work? For example, can a car with a more powerful engine always do more work than a car with a less powerful engine?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The amount of work an engine can do depends on how much fuel is available. The power indicates how quickly that work can be done. A car with a full gas tank and an underpowered engine can do more total work than a more powerful engine with an empty gas tank.</p>

    <li>How long will it take for a car engine that develops 75.0 kW of power to do 247 kJ of work in accelerating the car to highway speed?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}</p>
<p class="TeX">P\Delta t = \Delta E</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta t = \frac{\Delta E}{P} = \rm{\frac{247000\ J}{75000\ W} = 3.29\ s}</p>

<p class="TeX">\epsilon  = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}} = \rm{\frac{1920\ J}{7000\ J} = 0.274 = 27.4\%}</p>

    <li>The diesel engine of a locomotive has an efficiency of 12.5% in transforming the chemical energy of the fuel into useful work as the locomotive hauls the train up a hill.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>If the engine does 4.25 × 10<sup>7</sup> J of useful work in hauling the train up the hill, how much chemical energy (fuel) did the engine consume?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">\epsilon  = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\Delta E_{input}}</p>
<p class="TeX">\epsilon \Delta E_{input} = \Delta E_{useful}</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta E_{input} = \frac{\Delta E_{useful}}{\epsilon}
    = \rm{\frac{4.25\times 10^7\ J}{0.125} = 3.40\times 10^8\ J}</p>
        </div>
    
        <li>How much waste (thermal and sound energy) did the engine produce?</li>
<p class="TeX Answer">\begin{align}\Delta E_{waste} &= \Delta E_{input} - \Delta E_{useful}
\\ &= \rm{3.40\times 10^8\ J - 4.25\times 10^7\ J}
