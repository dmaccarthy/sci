<section class="Slide"><h3>Force</h3>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">force</em> is an interaction in which two objects push or pull on each other.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Force is measured in newtons:<p class="TeX">\rm {N = kg\cdot {m\over s^2}}</p></li>
        <li>A newton is the amount of force needed to make a 1-kilogram object accelerate at 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <li>Force is a <em class="Defn">vector</em>; it acts in a specific direction.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
    <p>Some common forces are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em class="Defn">Gravity</em>: An attractive force between masses.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Elastic</em>: Exerted by a stretched or compressed object trying to return to its original shape (bow, spring, bungee).</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Tension</em>: Exerted by an object that does not stretch (rope, rod).</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Normal</em>: Exerted by a surface (ground, floor, table) on an object in contact; acts perpendicular to the surface.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Friction</em>: Exerted by a surface on an object opposite to the motion; acts parallel to the surface.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Air Resistance</em>: Exerted by air (or other gases) on objects moving through.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Applied</em>: Exerted by a person, animal, or machine.</li>
        <li>Others: <em class="Defn">Buoyancy</em>, <em class="Defn">Electric</em>, <em class="Defn">Magnetic</em>, <em class="Defn">Nuclear</em></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Transformations</h3>
    <p>When a force acts on an object, it may cause the object’s kinetic energy to change.</p>
    <div><p>The <em>amount</em> of kinetic energy transformed is called the <em class="Defn">work</em> done by the force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">W = \Delta E_k</p></div>
    <ul>
        <li>A force that acts in the direction of motion (or at less than 90°) will cause an <em>increase</em> in kinetic energy (a <em>positive</em> amount of work).</li>
        <li>A force that acts opposite to the direction of motion (or at more than 90°) will cause an <em>decrease</em> in kinetic energy (a <em>negative</em> amount of work).</li>
        <li>A force that acts at exacly 90° does <em>zero</em> work. It causes a change in the direction of motion but not in the kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>This is often the case for the normal force.</li>
        <li>
            If more than one force does work on an object, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the <em>total</em> work done by all forces.
            <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \Sigma W</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the Law of Energy Convervation, the kinetic energy gained (lost) must come from (go) somewhere.</p>
    <p>Forces that transform kinetic energy to or from potential energy (without affecting the total mechanical energy) are classified as <em class="Defn">conservative</em> forces.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gravitational and elastic forces are conservative.</li>
        <li>Most of the other forces above are <em class="Defn">non-conservative</em>; they transform energy between mechanical and non-mechanical forces.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>The circle represents the boundary between the system and its environment.</li>
        <li>The arrows represent the energy transformed (work done) by each of the three forces.</li>
        <li>Work done by a force always involves a gain or loss of <em>kinetic</em> energy.</li>
        <li>Work is <em>positive</em> when kinetic energy increases (arrow points toward <span class="TeX">E_k</span>).</li>
        <li>Work is <em>negative</em> when kinetic energy decreases (arrow points away from <span class="TeX">E_k</span>).</li>
        <li>The change in kinetic energy (+3.0 joules) is the <em>total</em> of the work done by all three forces.</li>
        <li>An energy flow diagram combined with “initial” and “final” energy bar charts is sometimes called a <em class="Defn">LOL Diagram</em>.</li>
        <li>The L’s represent the axes of the bar charts and the O represents the system / environment boundary.</li>

    <li>A student slowly lifts a weight at constant speed. How is it possible that the student is doing work, but the object is not gaining kinetic energy?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The force the student applies is not the only force. The force of gravity is acting in the opposite direction. The student is doing a positive amount of work, while gravity does a negative amount of work. The total work done is zero if the speed is constant.</p>

    <li>A 30.0-kilogram student slides down an icy hill on a sled. The student’s speed is 3.00 m/s at the top of the 5.00-metre high hill. When the student reaches the bottom of the hill, her speed has increased to 8.00 m/s.

    <li>A 200-gram package is dropped from the top of a 27.6-metre tall building. The package strikes the ground with a speed of 18.4 m/s.

    <li>A 1200 kg car is moving at 40.0 km/h initially. When the driver steps on the accelerator, the car experiences an applied force due to the engine that does 50.0 kJ of work while moving 100 metres. While the car is accelerating, –15.0 kilojoules of work results from friction and air resistance. Use a LOL Diagram to determine the final speed of the car.</li>

    <li>Define force and work (as these terms are used in physics) and explain the relationship between the two concepts.</li>
    <p class="Answer"><em class="Defn">Force</em> is a push or pull interaction between two objects. <em class="Defn">Work</em> is the amount of kinetic energy gained or lossed by a moving object due to a force acting on the object.</p>

    <li>Identify the common types of forces and the describe circumstances under which those forces arise.</li>
    <p class="Answer">See notes.</p>

    <li>What do we mean by conservative and non-conservative forces? Give examples of each type of force.</li>
    <p class="Answer"><em class="Defn">Conservative forces</em> transform potential to kinetic energy (or vice versa) without affecting the total mechanical energy. These include gravitational and elastic forces. <em class="Defn">Non-conservative</em> forces (e.g. friction) transform kinetic to non-mechanical forms of energy, or vice versa (e.g. an applied force acting in the direction of the motion.)</p>

    <li>How should we interpret positive or negative amounts of work?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Positive work means kinetic energy is gained and negative work means kinetic energy is lost.</p>
