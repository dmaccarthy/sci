<section class="Slide"><h3>Force</h3>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">force</em> is an interaction in which two objects push or pull on each other.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Force is measured in newtons:<p class="TeX">\rm {N = kg\cdot {m\over s^2}}</p></li>
        <li data-cue="+">A newton is the amount of force needed to make a 1-kilogram object accelerate at 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Force is a <em class="Defn">vector</em>; it acts in a specific direction.</li>
    </ul>
    <div data-cue="+">
    <p>Some common forces are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em class="Defn">Gravity</em>: An attractive force between masses.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Elastic</em>: Exerted by a stretched or compressed object trying to return to its original shape (bow, spring, bungee).</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Tension</em>: Exerted by an object that does not stretch (rope, rod).</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Normal</em>: Exerted by a surface (ground, floor, table) on an object in contact; acts perpendicular to the surface.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Friction</em>: Exerted by a surface on an object opposite to the motion; acts parallel to the surface.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Air Resistance</em>: Exerted by air (or other gases) on objects moving through.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Applied</em>: Exerted by a person, animal, or machine.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Others: <em class="Defn">Buoyancy</em>, <em class="Defn">Electric</em>, <em class="Defn">Magnetic</em>, <em class="Defn">Nuclear</em></li>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Transformations</h3>
    <p>When a force acts on an object, it may cause the object’s kinetic energy to change.</p>
    <div data-cue="+"><p>The <em>amount</em> of kinetic energy transformed is called the <em class="Defn">work</em> done by the force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">W = \Delta E_k</p></div>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>A force that acts in the direction of motion (or at less than 90°) will cause an <em>increase</em> in kinetic energy (a <em>positive</em> amount of work).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">A force that acts opposite to the direction of motion (or at more than 90°) will cause an <em>decrease</em> in kinetic energy (a <em>negative</em> amount of work).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">A force that acts at exacly 90° does <em>zero</em> work. It causes a change in the direction of motion but not in the kinetic energy.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">This is often the case for the normal force.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">
            If more than one force does work on an object, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the <em>total</em> work done by all forces.
            <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \Sigma W</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">According to the Law of Energy Convervation, the kinetic energy gained (lost) must come from (go) somewhere.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Forces that transform kinetic energy to or from potential energy (without affecting the total mechanical energy) are classified as <em class="Defn">conservative</em> forces.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Gravitational and elastic forces are conservative.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Most of the other forces above are <em class="Defn">non-conservative</em>; they transform energy between mechanical and non-mechanical forces.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p class="Blue">Identify the forces and describe the energy transformations / work done for a student pushing a crate up a ramp.</p>

    <li>A student slowly lifts a weight at constant speed. How is it possible that the student is doing work, but the object is not gaining kinetic energy?</li>
    <div class="Answer">The force the student applies is not the only force. The force of gravity is acting in the opposite direction. The student is doing a positive amount of work, while gravity does a negative amount of work. The total work done is zero if the speed is constant.</div>

    <li>A 1200 kg car is moving at 40.0 km/h initially. When the driver steps on the accelerator, the car experiences an applied force due to the engine that does 50.0 kJ of work while moving 100 metres. While the car is accelerating, –15.0 kilojoules of work results from friction and air resistance. Use a LOL Diagram to determine the final speed of the car.</li>
