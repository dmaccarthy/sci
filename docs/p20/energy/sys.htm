<section class="Slide"><h3>Type of Systems</h3>
    <p><b>Isolated System</b>: A system that does not exchange either matter or energy with its environment.</p>
    <p><b>Closed System</b>: A system that can exchange energy but not matter with its environment.</p>
    <p><b>Open System</b>: A system that can exchange both energy and matter with its environment.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
    <p>To apply the Law of Energy Conservation, we must account for any energy added or removed from the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy that will be <em>added</em> to the system is included with the <em>initial</em> energy.</li>
        <li>Energy that has been <em>removed</em> from the system is included with the <em>final</em> energy.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 300-gram ball is dropped from a height of 4.00 metres. When the ball reaches the ground, its speed is measured to be 7.00 m/s.</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{gi} = mgh_i = {\rm{0.300\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 4.00\ m = 11.8\ J}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = {1\over 2}mv_f^2 = {\rm{{1\over 2}0.300\ kg\cdot (7.00\ m/s)^2 = 7.35\ J}}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The “missing” 4.42 joules is the energy that leaves the system.</li>
        <li>This energy is the sound and thermal energy produced by the air resistance force.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/energy/img/sys.js#bar" class="s24"></svg></p>
    <div>
        <p>An <em class="Defn">energy flow diagram</em> (also called a Sankey diagram) illustrates the energy transformations.</p>
        <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/energy/img/sys.js#flow1" class="s20"></svg></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>The circle represents the boundary between the system and the environment.</li>
        <li>Mechanical energy transformations should always involve kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>For example, if a spring is used to launch a ball into the air, the elastic potential energy transforms first into kinetic energy and then into gravitational potential energy.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p>Most energy transformations produce unwanted “waste” forms of energy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For example, a light bulb is intended to transform electrical energy into light energy. In reality, a significant fraction of the energy is wasted in the form of heat.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p>Scientists use the concept of <em class="Defn">efficiency</em> to describe the fraction or percentage of the energy input that is transformed into its intended or useful output:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful} \over |\Delta E_{input}|}</p>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>To say that a light bulb is 20% efficient means that 20% of the electrical energy consumed becomes light energy, and the remaining 80% of the energy consumed becomes waste (thermal energy).</li>
    <li>Note that efficiency does not have any units, since the units of the numerator and denominator are the same.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">Second Law of Thermodynamics</em> states that energy transformations will always produce some heat, and therefore have an efficiency of less than 100% when thermal energy is not the intended output.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">Calculate the efficiency for the falling ball in Example 1.</p>
    <p>The <em>input</em> is the gravitational potential energy that the ball has to begin with, 11.8 J.</p>
    <p>The <em>useful</em> output is the kinetic energy that the ball reaches the ground with, 7.35 J.</p>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon = {\Delta E_{useful} \over |\Delta E_{input}|} = \rm \frac{7.35\ J}{11.8\ J} = 0.624</p>
    <p>In other words, 62.4% of the gravitational potential energy becomes kinetic energy, while the other 37.6% becomes waste forms of energy such as thermal and/or sound energy.</p>

<li>A 2.50 kg mass is slid up an incline (ramp) with an initial speed of 2.50 m/s (i.e. at the bottom of the ramp).
<ol type="a">
    <li>Imagine that there is no friction. Use energy conservation to determine the height that the mass reaches before coming to stop and then starting to slide back down the ramp. Include energy bar charts as part of your solution.</li>

    <li>If there is friction, would the maximum height of the mass be higher, lower, or the same as you calculated in (a)? Explain.</li>
