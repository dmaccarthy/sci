    <li>A 500-gram ball is dropped from a height of 2.00 metres.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate what the final speed of the ball should be just before it contacts the ground if the mechanical energy remains constant.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
<p>The initial energy is:
<p class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \rm{0.500\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 2.00\ m = 9.81\ J}</p>

If no energy is added or removed, the final kinetic energy will also be 9.81 J.
<p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2</p>
<p class="TeX">\frac{2E_{kf}}{m} = v_f^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{kf}}{m}}
    = \rm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 9.81\ J}{0.500\ kg}} = 6.26\ m/s}</p>
        </div>

<li>The actual final speed of the ball just before it contacts the ground is measured as 5.00 m/s. Calculate the change in mechanical energy. Draw a pair of energy bar charts and an energy flow diagram to illustrate the energy transformation.</li>
<div class="Answer">
<p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 = \rm{\frac{1}{2} (0.500\ kg) (5.00\ m/s)^2 = 6.25\ J}</p>

The change in energy is:
<p class="TeX">\Delta E = \rm{6.25\ J - 9.81\ J = -3.56\ J}</p>
This means that 3.56 J energy left the system as “waste”.</p>

        <li>Does the change in mechanical energy represent energy gained by the system from the environment, or energy lost by the system to the environment?</li>

    <li>A 2.50 kg mass is slid up an incline (ramp) with an initial speed of 2.50 m/s (i.e. at the bottom of the ramp).
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Imagine that there is no friction. Use energy conservation to determine the height that the mass reaches before coming to stop and then starting to slide back down the ramp. Include energy bar charts as part of your solution.</li>

Initial:

        <li>If there is friction, would the maximum height of the mass be higher, lower, or the same as you calculated in (a)? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">It would be lower. Friction causes the system to lose energy as thermal and possibly sound. With less energy, the mass cannot travel as high.</div>

        <li>The maximum height that the mass reaches up the ramp is measured to be 25.0 cm. Draw a new “final” energy bar graph to determine the amount of “waste” energy produced by the friction force. Also draw an energy flow diagram.</li>
