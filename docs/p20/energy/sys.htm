<section class="Slide"><h3>Type of Systems</h3>
    <p><b>Isolated System</b>: A system that does not exchange either matter or energy with its environment.</p>
    <p><b>Closed System</b>: A system that can exchange energy but not matter with its environment.</p>
    <p><b>Open System</b>: A system that can exchange both energy and matter with its environment.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
    <p>To apply the Law of Energy Conservation, we must account for any energy added or removed from the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy that will be <em>added</em> to the system is included with the <em>initial</em> energy.</li>
        <li>Energy that has been <em>removed</em> from the system is included with the <em>final</em> energy.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 300-gram ball is dropped from a height of 4.00 metres. When the ball reaches the ground, its speed is measured to be 7.00 m/s.</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{gi} = mgh_i = {\rm{0.300\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 4.00\ m = 11.8\ J}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = {1\over 2}mv_f^2 = {\rm{{1\over 2}0.300\ kg\cdot (7.00\ m/s)^2 = 7.35\ J}}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The “missing” 4.42 joules is the energy that leaves the system.</li>
        <li>This energy is the sound and thermal energy produced by the air resistance force.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/energy/img/sys.js#bar" class="s24"></svg></p>

        <p>An <em class="Defn">energy flow diagram</em> (also called a Sankey diagram) illustrates the energy transformations.</p>

    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>The circle represents the boundary between the system and the environment.</li>
        <li>Mechanical energy transformations should always involve kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>For example, if a spring is used to launch a ball into the air, the elastic potential energy transforms first into kinetic energy and then into gravitational potential energy.</li>

<li>A 500-gram ball is dropped from a height of 2.00 metres.
<ol type="a">
    <li>Calculate what the final speed of the ball should be just before it contacts the ground if the mechanical energy remains constant.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The initial energy is:</p>
        <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \rm 0.500\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 2.00\ m = 9.81\ J</p>
        <p>If no energy is added or removed, the final kinetic energy will also be 9.81 J.</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2</p>
        <p class="TeX">\frac{2E_{kf}}{m} = v_f^2</p>
        <p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{kf}}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 9.81\ J}{0.500\ kg}} = 6.26\ m/s</p>
    </div>

    <li>The actual final speed of the ball just before it contacts the ground is measured as 5.00 m/s. Calculate the change in mechanical energy. Draw a pair of energy bar charts and an energy flow diagram to illustrate the energy transformation.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="TeX">E_{kf} = \frac{1}{2} mv_f^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2} (0.500\ kg) (5.00\ m/s)^2 = 6.25\ J</p>
        <p>The change in energy is:</p>
        <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">\Delta E = \rm 6.25\ J - 9.81\ J = -3.56\ J</p>
        <p>This means that 3.56 J energy left the system as “waste”.</p>

        <p class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/energy/img/sys.js#flow1#1"></svg></p>
    </div>
    
    <li>Does the change in mechanical energy represent energy gained by the system from the environment, or energy lost by the system to the environment?</li>
    <p class="Answer">This is a loss of energy by the system to the environment.</p>

    <li>Classify the system as isolated, closed, or open. Explain.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Closed. No matter enters or leaves the system but energy does.</p>

    <li>A 32.0 kg child is skating with an initial speed of 1.25 m/s. The child’s father pushes her, causing her speed to increase to 2.30 m/s. Calculate the energy added to the system by the child’s father. Draw energy bar charts to illustrate the energy transformations.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="TeX">E_{ki} =\frac{1}{2} mv_i^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2} (32.0\ kg) (1.25\ m/s)^2 = 25.0\ J </p>

    <li>In order for the system to have gained energy, the surroundings must have lost energy. Explain what form of energy the surroundings lost. Draw an energy flow diagram for this scenario.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The father has to metabolize 59.6 J of food (chemical) energy* in order to add energy to the system. (He actually had to metabolize more than this, because the energy transformation is less than 100% efficient.)</p>

    <p>A 60.0-gram arrow is loaded into an archery bow and held 1.25 metres above the ground. The bow has an elastic constant of 100 N/m. The arrow is shot by pulling the bowstring back 40.0 cm, aiming, and releasing. As the arrow flies toward the target, air resistance transforms 3.00 joules of energy into sound and thermal energy.</p>
    <p>Calculate the speed of the arrow just before it strikes the target 80.0 cm above the ground. Include appropriate energy bar charts and an energy flow diagram.</p>

<li>A 2.50 kg mass is slid up an incline (ramp) with an initial speed of 2.50 m/s (i.e. at the bottom of the ramp).
<ol type="a">
    <li>Imagine that there is no friction. Use energy conservation to determine the height that the mass reaches before coming to stop and then starting to slide back down the ramp. Include energy bar charts as part of your solution.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Initial:</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv_i^2 = \rm \frac{1}{2} (2.50\ kg) (2.50\ m/s)^2 = 7.81\ J</p>
        <p>Final:</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_g = mgh_f</p>
        <p class="TeX">h_f = \frac{E_g}{mg} = \rm \frac{7.8125\ J}{2.50\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 0.319\ m</p>
    </div>

    <li>If there is friction, would the maximum height of the mass be higher, lower, or the same as you calculated in (a)? Explain.</li>
    <p class="Answer">It would be lower. Friction causes the system to lose energy as thermal and possibly sound. With less energy, the mass cannot travel as high.</p>

    <li>The maximum height that the mass reaches up the ramp is measured to be 25.0 cm. Draw a new “final” energy bar graph to determine the amount of “waste” energy produced by the friction force. Also draw an energy flow diagram.</li>
    <div class="Answer">

<p>A 625 kg roller coaster car starts from rest at a height of 15.0 metres as illustrated.</p>
<p class="Center"><img width="480" alt="Roller Coaster" src="p20/energy/img/loop.png"/></p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Determine the speed of the car at point C, neglecting friction and air resistance. Use energy bar charts for the starting position and point C.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="Center"> class="s20" data-svg2="p20/energy/img/sys.js#Q5"></svg></p>
        <p class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \rm 625\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 15.0\ m = 91969\ J = 92.0\ kJ</p>

        <p>Since there is no friction or air resistance to transform energy into “waste”:</p>
        <p class="TeX">E_k = \rm 91969\ J - 18394\ J = 73575\ J = 73.6\ kJ</p>
        <p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 73575\ J}{625\ kg}} = 15.3\ m/s</p>

    <li>Write a general relationship (equation) between the car’s height and speed and use it to calculate the speed at points A and B. Do this by equating the formulas for the initial and final energy rather than the calculated numerical values.</li>

        <p class="TeX">gh_i - gh_f = \frac{1}{2} v_f^2</p>

    <li>When friction and air resistance are accounted for, they are responsible for transforming 21.7 kilojoules of mechanical energy into sound and/or thermal energy, between the start of the ride and point C.
