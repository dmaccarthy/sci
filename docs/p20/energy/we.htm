<section class="Slide"><h3>Work-Energy Theorem</h3>
<p>Reminders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Forces</em> cause objects to gain or lose kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>The amount of kinetic energy gained is called the <em>work</em> done by the force.</li>
        <li>A negative work means that kinetic energy is being lost.</li>
        <li>When more than one force does work on an object, the change in kinetic energy equals the <em>total</em> work done by all forces.
            <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">\Delta E_k = \Sigma W</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The amount of work that a force does is determined by three factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How strong the force is.</li>
        <li>How far the object moves while the force is acting.</li>
        <li>The direction of the force relative to the object’s motion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The relationship between these variables is called the <em class="Defn">work-energy theorem</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For 1D motion, when the force can only act in the forward or backward directions:<p class="TeX">W = {\vec {\bf F}}_\parallel\cdot{\Delta\vec {\bf d}}</p></li>
        <li>Force is measured in newtons:<p class="TeX">\rm J = N\cdot m</p></li>
        <li>In 2D or 3D, the force can act at an angle <span class="TeX">\Delta\theta</span> to the motion:
            <p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">W = F \Delta d \cos(\Delta\theta)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="NoPresent">In this formula, <span class="TeX">F</span> and <span class="TeX">\Delta d</span> refer to the <em>magnitudes</em> of the vectors. The directions are accounted for by <span class="TeX">\cos(\Delta\theta)</span>.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
<div data-cue="none" class="Blue">
<p>A 12.0-kilogram robot uses an electric motor to propel itself with 18.0 newtons of force. If the robot moves 3.00 metres in 2.00 seconds, starting from rest...</p>
<p data-cue="none">a) How much work did the motor do?</p>    
</div>
<p class="TeX">W_a = {\vec {\bf F}}_\parallel\cdot{\Delta\vec {\bf d}} = \rm{18.0\ N \cdot 3.00\ m = 54.0\ J}</p>
<p class="Blue">b) Calculate the final speed of the robot if there is no friction or air resistance.</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = W_a = {\rm 54.0\ J}</p>
<p>Note that because the initial kinetic energy is zero, the final kinetic energy is equal to the work.</p>    
<p class="TeX">E_k = {1\over 2}mv^2</p>
<p class="TeX">{2 E_k\over m} = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{2 E_k\over m} = \rm{\sqrt{2\cdot 54.0\ J\over 12.0\ kg} = 3.00\ m/s}</p>

<p class="Blue">c) Suppose there is a friction force of 8.00 N opposing the motion. Calculate the work done by the friction force. How would the final velocity change?</p>
<p class="TeX">W_f = \rm{-8.00\ N\cdot 3.00\ m = -24.0\ J}</p>
<div>
<p>The <em>total</em> work done by both forces would be:</p>
<p class="TeX">\Sigma W = W_a+W_f = \rm{54.0\ J + (-24.0\ J) = 30.0\ J}</p>
</div>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{2 E_k\over m} = \rm{\sqrt{2\cdot 30.0\ J\over 12.0\ kg} = 2.24\ m/s}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 20.0 kg mass accelerates from 2.00 m/s to 5.00 m/s while moving 2.00 m. Calculate the force acting on the mass.</p>
<p>Calculate work as the change in kinetic energy...</p>
<p class="TeX">E_{ki} = {1\over 2}mv_i^2 = \rm{{1\over 2} 20.0\ kg\cdot (2.00\ m/s)^2 = 40.0\ J}</p>
<p class="TeX">E_{kf} = {1\over 2}mv_f^2 = \rm{{1\over 2} 20.0\ kg\cdot (5.00\ m/s)^2 = 250\ J}</p>
<p class="TeX">W = \Delta E_k = \rm{250\ J - 40.0\ J = 210\ J}</p>
<div>
<p>Now use the Work-Energy Theorem to find the average force...</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_\parallel = {W\over \Delta \vec{\bf d}} = \rm{{210\ J \over 2.00\ m} = 105\ N}</p>
</div>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Non-Constant Force</h3>
    <p>When a force is not constant, we must use the <em>average</em> force to calculate the work.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One way of doing this is to calculate the area under a graph of the force versus the position.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Blue">Example 3: A 100 kg cyclist experiences a force as illustrated. How much work is done and what would the cyclist’s speed be if they started from rest?</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/energy/img/we.js#work"></svg></p>
    <p class="TeX">W = \Delta E_k = \rm{3000\ J}</p>
    <p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{2 E_k\over m} = \rm{\sqrt{2\cdot 3000\ J\over 100\ kg} = 7.75\ m/s}</p>

<li>A student pushes a 15.0-kilogram crate from rest with a force of 50.0 newtons for 1.25 seconds. The crate moves 1.50 metres while the student is pushing.
<ol type="a">
    <li>How much work did the student (applied force) do?</li>
    <p class="TeX Answer">W_a = \vec{\bf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm 50.0\ N \cdot 1.50\ m = 75.0\ J</p>

    <li>If there was no friction or air resistance acting on the crate, how much kinetic energy would the crate have? Explain.</li>        
    <p class="Answer">The crate has no energy initially because it is at rest. Since it gains 75.0 joules due to the applied force, its final kinetic energy will be 75.0 J.</p>

    <li>Calculate the final velocity of the crate when there is no friction.</li>
    <p class="TeX Answer">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 75.0\ J}{15.0\ kg}} = 3.16\ m/s</p>

    <li>Suppose there is a friction force of 20.0 N opposing the motion. Calculate the work done by the friction force and the final speed.</li>        
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="TeX">W_f = \vec{\bf F}_f \cdot \Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm -20.0\ N \cdot 1.50\ m = -30.0\ J</p>
        <p>The change in kinetic energy is the total work done by both forces:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Delta E_k = W_a + W_f = \rm 75.0\ J + (-30.0\ J) = 45.0\ J</p>
        <p class="TeX">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 45.0\ J}{15.0\ kg}} = 2.45\ m/s</p>

<li>A 75.0 kg cyclist is initially moving at 5.00 m/s. She then accelerates to a final speed of 12.0 m/s while moving 20.0 metres. Neglect the effects of air resistance and friction.
<ol type="a">
    <li>How much work did the student do in accelerating herself? In other words, how much kinetic energy did she gain?</li>
    <div class="Answer">

    <li>How much average force did the cyclist experience?</li>

<li><p>When a tennis player serves the ball, the amount of force applied by the racket to the ball depends on how much the strings stretch. The graph below shows how the force varies during a serve.</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/energy/img/we.js#tennis"></svg></p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Calculate the work done on the tennis ball.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>For the first 40 cm:</p><p class="TeX">W_1 = \rm \frac{1}{2}\cdot 80\ N \cdot 0.40\ m = 16\ J</p>
        <p>For the next 10 cm:</p><p class="TeX">W_2 = \rm 80\ N \cdot 0.10\ m = 8.0\ J</p>
        <p>For the last 25 cm:</p><p class="TeX">W_3 = \rm \frac{1}{2}\cdot 80\ N \cdot 0.25\ m = 10\ J</p>
        <p>The total work is:</p><p class="TeX">W = W_1 + W_2 + W_3 = \rm 34\ J</p>
    </div>

    <li>If the mass of the tennis ball is 80.0 grams and it was initially at rest, what would its speed be as it leaves the racket?</li>
    <p class="TeX Answer">v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \rm \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 34\ J}{0.0800\ kg}} = 29.2\ m/s</p>

<li>A student uses 10.0 newtons of force to push a 5.00-kilogram mass 2.00 metres up an 8.00° incline. The mass starts and ends at rest. Calculate (a) the amount of “waste” (sound and thermal energy) produced and (b) the average force of friction acting on the mass.</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/energy/img/we.js#ramp"></svg></p>
    <p>First find the height using trigonometry:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\sin(8.00^\circ) = \frac{h_f}{\Delta d}</p>
    <p class="TeX">h_f = \Delta d\cdot \sin(8.00^\circ) = \rm{2.00\ m\cdot\sin(8.00^\circ) = 0.278\ m}</p>
    <p>Now calculate the gravitational potential energy at the top:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{gf} = mgh_f = \rm{5.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.278\ m = 13.7\ J}</p>
    <p>Next calculate the work done by the applied force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">W_a = \vec{\bf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{10.0\ N \cdot 2.00\ m = 20.0\ J}</p>
    <p>Using energy conservation, the final energy (waste and gravitational potential) must equal the energy added:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{waste} + \rm{13.7\ J = 20.0\ J}</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_{waste} = \rm{20.0\ J - 13.7\ J = 6.35\ J}</p>
    <p>The waste energy is the (negative of) work done by friction:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_f = \frac{W_f}{\Delta\vec{\bf d}} = \rm{\frac{-6.35\ J}{+2.00\ m} = -3.17\ N}</p>
