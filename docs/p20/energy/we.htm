    <li>A student uses 10.0 newtons of force to push a 5.00-kilogram mass 2.00 metres up an 8.00° incline. The mass starts and ends at rest. Calculate (a) the amount of “waste” (sound and thermal energy) produced and (b) the average force of friction acting on the mass.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="Center"><img src="p20/energy/img/ramp_trig.png" alt="Diagram"/></p>
First find the height using trogonometry:
<p class="TeX">\sin(8.00^\circ) = \frac{h_f}{\Delta d}</p>
<p class="TeX">h_f = \Delta d\cdot \sin(8.00^\circ) = \rm{2.00\ m\cdot\sin(8.00^\circ) = 0.278\ m}</p>
Now calculate the gravitational potential energy at the top:
<p class="TeX">E_{gf} = mgh_f = \rm{5.00\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 0.278\ m = 13.7\ J}</p>
Next calculate the work done by the applied force:
<p class="TeX">W_a = \vec{\bf F}_a \cdot \Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{10.0\ N \cdot 2.00\ m = 20.0\ J}</p>
Using energy conservation, the final energy (waste and gravitational potential) must equal the energy added:
<p class="TeX">E_{waste} + \rm{13.7\ J = 20.0\ J}</p>
<p class="TeX">E_{waste} = \rm{20.0\ J - 13.7\ J = 6.35\ J}</p>
The waste energy is the (negative of) work done by friction:
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_f = \frac{W_f}{\Delta\vec{\bf d}} = \rm{\frac{-6.35\ J}{2.00\ m} = -3.17\ N}</p>
