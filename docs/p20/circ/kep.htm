<section id="cop" class="Slide"><h3>Ptolemy &amp; Copernicus</h3>
<p>Pre-modern scientists such as Ptolemy believed that the Earth was stationary at the centre of the universe.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The Sun, Moon, stars, and planets orbited around the Earth.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">This belief was based on the observation that there is no sensation of motion while at rest on Earth, and also on theological beliefs.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Models with the Earth at the centre are called <em class="Defn">geocentric</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">One of the major problems with the geocentric model is that it does not adequately explain the observed <em class="Defn">retrograde motion</em> of planets like Mars.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When seen in Earth’s sky, every few years Mars seems to stop in its orbit, reverse direction for a few months, and then return to its original path.</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="+">Copernicus constructed a new model with the Sun at the centre of the solar system, with Earth and the other planets orbiting around the Sun in perfect circles.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>This model explains the retrograde motion of Mars as being caused by Earth overtaking Mars as it orbits.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Models with the Sun at the centre are called <em class="Defn">heliocentric</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="kep" class="Slide"><h3>Kepler</h3>
<p>Johannes Kepler used precise telescope observations (made by Tycho Brahe) to conclude that the heliocentric model was generally correct, but that the orbits of the planets were not perfect circles.</p>

    <p><b>Kepler’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</b>: Planets orbit the Sun along ellipse-shaped trajectories with the Sun located at one of the focus points.<p>

<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>An ellipse is a “stretched” circle.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The longest “diameter” of an ellipse is called the <em class="Defn">major axis</em>.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The <em class="Defn">focus</em> point (Sun) is located on the major axis but is off-centre.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The point where the orbit crosses the major axis close to the focus is called the <em class="Defn">perihelion</em>. This is the point of the orbit that is closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The orbit’s furthest point from the Sun is called the <em class="Defn">aphelion</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p data-cue="+"><b>Kepler’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</b>: The areas of the sectors formed by the Sun and the planet’s initial and final positions
    (shaded regions of the diagram) are the same for equal amounts of time at every point in the orbit; the orbit “sweeps out” area at a constant rate.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>Closer to the perihelion, the planet’s potential energy due to the Sun’s gravity is lower, thus its kinetic energy is greater.</li>

    <p><b>Kepler’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</b>: There is a non-linear relationship between the mean orbital radius (<span class="TeX">r</span>) and the period (<span class="TeX">T</span>), the time for one complete orbit):</p>
    <p class="TeX">T^2=kr^3</p>

<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The constant <span class="TeX">k = \mathrm{1\ yr^2/au^3 = 2.97 \times 10^{−19}\ s^2/m^3}</span>, is determined by the Sun’s gravity.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The <em class="Defn">mean orbital radius</em> is half the length of the major axis.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">Planets further from the Sun take longer to complete each orbit.</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The period of Earth’s orbit is defined as a terrestrial year (<span class="TeX">\mathrm{yr = 3.16 \times 10^7\ s}</span>) and Earth’s mean orbital radius is defined as an astronomical unit (<span class="TeX">\mathrm{au = 1.496 \times 10^{11}\ m}</span>).</li>
	<li data-cue="+">The relationship can be expressed alternatively using ratios of the periods and orbits for two different planets:
    <p class="TeX">\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2=\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3</p></li>
    <li data-cue="+">When expressed this way <em>any</em> units can be used, as long as the units are the same for both orbiting objects, since the units will cancel.</li>
</ul>

<p data-cue="+">Kepler’s Laws apply not only to the motion of the planets around the Sun, but also to any situation where the motion of an object is determined solely by the gravity of a single, large, spherical object, such as the motion of the Moon or an artificial satellite around the Earth.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The value of the constant <span class="TeX">k</span> is different for Earth’s gravity (or any other planet or star) than for the Sun’s.</li>

        <li>How many times larger than Earth’s orbital radius is this? Explain why the orbital radius is not three times bigger than Earth’s even though the orbital period is exactly three times that of Earth.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The satellite orbits at 2.08 times the orbital radius of Earth (i.e. 2.08 au) even though the period is three times larger than Earth’s.  This is because Kepler’s 3rd Law is non-linear; the orbital period and orbital radius have different exponents in the equation.</div>
