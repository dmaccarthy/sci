</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Ptolemy &amp; Copernicus</h3>
<p>Pre-modern scientists such as Ptolemy believed that the Earth was stationary at the centre of the universe.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Sun, Moon, stars, and planets orbited around the Earth.</li>
    <li>This belief was based on the observation that there is no sensation of motion while at rest on Earth, and also on theological beliefs.</li>
    <li>Models with the Earth at the centre are called <em class="Defn">geocentric</em>.</li>
    <li>One of the major problems with the geocentric model is that it does not adequately explain the observed <em class="Defn">retrograde motion</em> of planets like Mars.</li>
    <li>When seen in Earth’s sky, every few years Mars seems to stop in its orbit, reverse direction for a few months, and then return to its original path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Copernicus constructed a new model with the Sun at the centre of the solar system, with Earth and the other planets orbiting around the Sun in perfect circles.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This model explains the retrograde motion of Mars as being caused by Earth overtaking Mars as it orbits.</li>
    <li>Models with the Sun at the centre are called <em class="Defn">heliocentric</em>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Kepler</h3>
<p>Johannes Kepler used precise telescope observations (made by Tycho Brahe) to conclude that the heliocentric model was generally correct, but that the orbits of the planets were not perfect circles.</p>
<p><b data-cue="none">Kepler’s 1<sup>st</sup> Law</b>: Planets orbit the Sun along ellipse-shaped trajectories with the Sun located at one of the focus points.</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/circ/img/kep.js#orbit"></svg></p>
<p class="Center NoPresent">F = Focus; C = Geometric Centre<br/>P = Perihelion; A = Aphelion</p>
<ul>
    <li>An ellipse is a “stretched” circle.</li>
	<li>The longest “diameter” of an ellipse is called the <em class="Defn">major axis</em>.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">focus</em> point (Sun) is located on the major axis but is off-centre.</li>
	<li>The point where the orbit crosses the major axis close to the focus is called the <em class="Defn">perihelion</em>. This is the point of the orbit that is closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The orbit’s furthest point from the Sun is called the <em class="Defn">aphelion</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Kepler’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law</b>: The areas of the sectors formed by the Sun and the planet’s initial and final positions
    (shaded regions of the diagram) are the same for equal amounts of time at every point in the orbit; the orbit “sweeps out” area at a constant rate.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Closer to the perihelion, the planet’s potential energy due to the Sun’s gravity is lower, thus its kinetic energy is greater.</li>
</ul>

<div>
    <p><b>Kepler’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law</b>: There is a non-linear relationship between the mean orbital radius (<span class="TeX">r</span>) and the period (<span class="TeX">T</span>), the time for one complete orbit):</p>
    <p class="TeX">T^2=kr^3</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>The constant <span class="TeX">k = \rm{1\ yr^2/au^3 = 2.97 \times 10^{−19}\ s^2/m^3}</span>, is determined by the Sun’s gravity.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">mean orbital radius</em> is half the length of the major axis (commonly called the <em class="Defn">semi-major</em> axis).</li>
	<li>Planets further from the Sun take longer to complete each orbit.</li>
	<li>The period of Earth’s orbit is defined as a terrestrial year (<span class="TeX">\rm{yr = 3.16 \times 10^7\ s}</span>) and Earth’s mean orbital radius is defined as an astronomical unit (<span class="TeX">\rm{au = 1.496 \times 10^{11}\ m}</span>).</li>
	<li>The relationship can be expressed alternatively using ratios of the periods and orbits for two different planets:
    <p class="TeX">\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2=\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3</p></li>
    <li>When expressed this way <em>any</em> units can be used, as long as the units are the same for both orbiting objects, since the units will cancel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kepler’s Laws apply not only to the motion of the planets around the Sun, but also to any situation where the motion of an object is determined solely by the gravity of a single, large, spherical object, such as the motion of the Moon or an artificial satellite around the Earth.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The value of the constant <span class="TeX">k</span> is different for Earth’s gravity (or any other planet or star) than for the Sun’s.</li>
    <li>For orbits around Earth, we use the terms <em class="Defn">perigee</em> and <em class="Defn">apogee</em> instead of perihelion and aphelion.</li>
    <li>For orbits around other stars or planets we can use the general terms <em class="Defn">periapsis</em> and <em class="Defn">apoapsis</em>.

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A moon has an orbital radius of 8.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> metres and an orbital period of 12.0 days around some planet. At what radius should a satellite orbit so that its period would be 6.00 hours</p>
    <p class="TeX">\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3</p>

    <p class="TeX">\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{2/3} r_1 = r_2</p>

    <li>An unidentified object, possibly a comet or dwarf planet, orbits our Sun with a mean orbital radius of 8.32 × 10<sup>12</sup> m. Use Kepler’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law to calculate the object’s orbital period. [Hint: Express the mean orbital radius in au first.]</li>

        <p class="TeX">r = \rm \frac{8.32\times 10^{12}\ m}{1.496\times 10^{11}\ m/au} = 55.6\ au</p>

    <li>Scientists planning to launch a research satellite to study the Sun want the satellite to orbit the Sun with a period of 3.00 years.

        <li>How many times larger than Earth’s orbital radius is this? Explain why the orbital radius is not three times bigger than Earth’s even though the orbital period is exactly three times that of Earth.</li>
        <p class="Answer">The satellite orbits at 2.08 times the orbital radius of Earth (i.e. 2.08 au) even though the period is three times larger than Earth’s. This is because Kepler’s 3rd Law is non-linear; the orbital period and orbital radius have different exponents in the equation.</p>

<ol> -->
    <li>Explain the difference between geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system, and why Copernicus believed the heliocentric model is correct.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Geocentric models have a stationary Earth at the centre. Heliocentric models have the Sun at the centre with Earth orbiting like the other planets do. The retrogradem otion of Mars, when observed from Earth, is one of the main reasons Copernicus favoured a heliocentric model.</p>

    <li>Define:<ol type="a">
        <li>Ellipse</li>
        <p class="Answer">A circle that has been stretched in one dimension.</p>

        <li>Major and Semi-major Axis</li>
        <p class="Answer">The longest axis of the ellipse is called the major axis. The semi-major axis is <em>half</em> of the major axis, i.e. from the centre to one endpoint.</p>

        <li>Minor and Semi-minor Axis	</li>
        <p class="Answer">The smaller diameter, perpendicular to the major axis, is called the minor axis. Half of the minor axis is the semi-minor axis.</p>

        <li>Eccentricity</li>
        <p class="Answer">The “stretchiness” of an ellipse; the eccentricity gets larger as the ratio of the major to minor axes increases.</p>

        <li>Focus</li>
        <p class="Answer">A specific point on the major axis that gets more off-centre as the eccentricity increases.</p>

        <li>Perihelion (Perigee, Periapsis)</li>
        <p class="Answer">The point where the major axis intersects the ellipse that is closest to the focus where the central mass (e.g. the Sun) is located.</p>

        <li>Aphelion (Apogee, Apoapsis)	</li>
        <p class="Answer">The point where the major axis intersects the ellipse that is farthest from the focus where the central mass (e.g. the Sun) is located.</p>

        <li>Astronomical Unit</li>
        <p class="Answer">A unit of distance equal to the mean orbit radius (and semi-major axis) of Earth’s orbit.</p>
    
        <!-- <li>Geosynchronous</li>
        <p class="Answer">An orbit around Earth with a period that matches one Earth day (24 hours).</p>

        <li>Geostationary</li>
        <p class="Answer">A geosynchronous orbit directly above the equator will have the effect that the satellite remains stationary relative to the ground.</p> -->

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Explain Kepler’s 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Laws of Planetary Motion. Include a diagram to illustrate.</li>
        <p class="Answer">See notes.</p>
    
        <li>Explain the terminology <em class="Defn">mean orbital radius</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">The separation of the orbiting planet from the Sun changes, being smallest at perihelion and largest at aphelion. The average of these distances equals the semi-major axis.</p>
    
        <li>State two different forms for writing the equation for Kepler’s 3rd Law. What are the advantages of each form?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p class="TeX">T^2=kr^3</p>
            <p>This is most useful for our own solar system when the value of <span class="TeX">k</span> is exactly 1 when using au and years as the units of distance and time.</p>
            <p class="TeX">\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^3</p>
            <p>This is useful for any two objects orbiting the same star or planet. We can use any units we want (as long as we use the same for both objects) because all units will cancel.</p>
        </div>
    
        <li>What are the assumptions of Kepler’s Laws? Under what circumstances do Kepler’s Laws not apply?</li>
        <p class="Answer">There must be one central object that contains nearly all the mass of the system, and the central object’s gravity must be the only force acting on the orbiting objects. Kepler’s Laws would not apply to systems with double stars, or to objects experiencing an applied force (rocket thrust) or air resistance (moving inside an atmosphere).</p>
