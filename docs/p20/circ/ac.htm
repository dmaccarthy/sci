<section class="Slide"><h3>Centripetal Acceleration</h3>
<p>Although the speed (scalar!) of an object is constant for uniform circular motion, the object’s <em>velocity</em> (vector!) is continuously changing due to changes in direction.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This means that the object is <em>accelerating</em> and there must be an <em>unbalanced force</em> causing the object to move in a circle.</li>
    <li>If there was no unbalanced force, the object would have to move in a straight line.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p>The illustration below (left) shows the motion of an object from <span class="TeX">P_1</span> to <span class="TeX">P_2</span> along a circle centred at point C. The illustration on the right is the vector diagram showing the change in velocity (<span class="TeX">\Delta{\vec{\bf v}}</span>).</p>
    <p class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="p20/circ/img/ac.png" class="s20"/></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>The blue and red triangles are <em>similar</em>; they are both isosceles triangles with the same angles.</li>
    <li>Similar triangles have the same ratio of sides:<p class="TeX">{s \over r} = {\Delta v\over v}</p></li>
    <li>Since <span class="TeX">s</span> is the distance from <span class="TeX">P_1</span> to <span class="TeX">P_2</span>, <span class="TeX">s=v\Delta t</span>: <p class="TeX">{v\Delta t\over r} = {\Delta v\over v}</p></li>
    <li>We can rearrange this to calculate the acceleration: <p class="TeX">a_c = {\Delta v\over \Delta t} = {v^2\over r}</p></li>
    <li>The subscript “c” is for centripetal; it reminds us that the direction of the acceleration vector is always directed toward the centre for UCM.</li>
    <li>We can get an alternate form of the equation by substituting <span class="TeX">v = {2\pi r\over T}</span> to eliminate <span class="TeX">v</span>:<p class="TeX">a_c=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}</p></li>
    <li>These equations are valid only for the <em>instantaneous</em> acceleration;
        this is because the distance between <span class="TeX">P_1</span> and <span class="TeX">P_2</span> measured along the circular arc is only approximately equal to the line segment <span class="TeX">s</span>, when <span class="TeX">P_1</span> and <span class="TeX">P_2</span> are very close together.</li>
    <li>The net force is also in the centripetal direction accoring to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law:<p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\bf{a}}}_c</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{a_c r}</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A curve on the highway has a radius of 250 metres. After an ice storm, the road is slippery and the coefficient of friction is 0.100. Assuming the road is unbanked (horizontal), what is the fastest safe speed for a car to move through the curve?</p>
<p>Because the road is unbanked, the normal and gravity forces balance:</p>
<p class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg</p>
<p>The only unbalanced force is friction:</p>
<p class="TeX">F_f = ma = \mu F_n = \mu mg</p>
<p>Divide by <span class="TeX">m</span>:</p>
<p class="TeX">a = \mu g = \rm 0.100\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 0.981\ m/s^2</p>
<p>The equation for centripetal acceleration is:</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{a_c r} = \rm \sqrt{0.981\ m/s^2\cdot 250\ m} = 15.7\ m/s = 56.4\ km/h</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 3</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">What would happen to a car that tried to take the curve at 25.0 m/s?</p>
<p>Solve for the radius:</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">r = \frac{v^2}{a_c} = \rm \frac{(25.0\ m/s)^2}{0.981\ m/s^2} = 637\ m</p>
<p>Since the radius of the car’s motion is much larger than the radius of the road, the car will slide to the outside and end up in the ditch!</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Connection to SHM</h3>
<p data-cue="none">The equations for UCM are similar to the equations for SHM:</p>

<p class="TeX" data-cue="none">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2}</p>
<p>The reason is that when an object is moving in a circle with constant speed, its <span class="TeX">x</span> and <span class="TeX">y</span> coordinates will change as a <span class="TeX">\sin</span> or <span class="TeX">\cos</span> function...</p>

        <li>A car rounding a circular turn with <span class="TeX">r</span> = 250 m can have a maximum centripetal acceleration of 7.00 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum speed that the car can have while rounding the turn?</li>

        <li>When the road is slippery, the maximum centripetal acceleration is reduced to 2.80 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the maximum speed that the car can have while rounding the turn under these slippery conditions?</li>

    <li>A mass spectrometer is a device used to identify isotopes (atoms of the same element that have different masses) present in a sample. Helium atoms are given velocities of 1.70 × 10<sup>3</sup> m/s and are then subjected to a magnetic force of 2.72 × 10<sup>–16</sup> N, which causes them to move in a circle.

    <div class="Answer">

    <p class="Answer">No! The “centripetal force” just means a net force acting toward the centre. What <em>causes</em> that force depends on the situation.</p>
