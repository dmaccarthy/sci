<section class="Slide"><h3>Centripetal Acceleration</h3>
<p>Although the speed (scalar!) of an object is constant for uniform circular motion, the object’s <em>velocity</em> (vector!) is continuously changing due to changes in direction.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This means that the object is <em>accelerating</em> and there must be an <em>unbalanced force</em> causing the object to move in a circle.</li>
    <li>If there was no unbalanced force, the object would have to move in a straight line.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p>The first illustration below shows the motion of an object from <span class="TeX">P_1</span> to <span class="TeX">P_2</span> along a circle centred at point C. The second illustration is the vector diagram showing the change in velocity (<span class="TeX">\Delta{\vec{\bf v}}</span>).</p>

</div>
<ul>
    <li>The blue and red triangles are <em>similar</em>; they are both isosceles triangles with the same angles.</li>
    <li>Similar triangles have the same ratio of sides:<p class="TeX">{s \over r} = {\Delta v\over v}</p></li>
    <li>Since <span class="TeX">s</span> is the distance from <span class="TeX">P_1</span> to <span class="TeX">P_2</span>, <span class="TeX">s=v\Delta t</span>: <p class="TeX">{v\Delta t\over r} = {\Delta v\over v}</p></li>
    <li>We can rearrange this to calculate the acceleration: <p class="TeX">a_c = {\Delta v\over \Delta t} = {v^2\over r}</p></li>
    <li>The subscript “c” is for centripetal; it reminds us that the direction of the acceleration vector is always directed toward the centre for UCM.</li>
    <li>We can get an alternate form of the equation by substituting <span class="TeX">v = {2\pi r\over T}</span> to eliminate <span class="TeX">v</span>:<p class="TeX">a_c=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}</p></li>
    <li>These equations are valid only for the <em>instantaneous</em> acceleration;
        this is because the distance between <span class="TeX">P_1</span> and <span class="TeX">P_2</span> measured along the circular arc is only approximately equal to the line segment <span class="TeX">s</span>, when <span class="TeX">P_1</span> and <span class="TeX">P_2</span> are very close together.</li>
    <li>The net force is also in the centripetal direction accoring to Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law:<p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\bf{a}}}_c</p></li>
</ul>

<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A curve on the highway has a radius of 250 metres. After an ice storm, the road is slippery and the coefficient of friction is 0.100. Assuming the road is unbanked (horizontal), what is the fastest safe speed for a car to move through the curve?</p>
<p>Because the road is unbanked, the normal and gravity forces balance:</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">F_n = F_g = mg</p>
<p>The only unbalanced force is friction:</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">F_f = ma</p>
<p class="TeX">\mu F_n = ma</p>
<p class="TeX">\mu mg = ma</p>
<p>Divide by <span class="TeX">m</span>:</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">a = \mu g = \rm 0.100\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 = 0.981\ m/s^2</p>
<p>The equation for centripetal acceleration is:</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{a_c r} = \rm \sqrt{0.981\ m/s^2\cdot 250\ m} </p>
<p class="TeX">v = \rm 15.7\ m/s = 56.4\ km/h</p>

<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">r = \frac{v^2}{a_c} = \rm \frac{(25.0\ m/s)^2}{0.981\ m/s^2} = 637\ m</p>
<p>Since the radius of the car’s motion is much larger than the radius of the road, the car will slide to the outside and end up in the ditch!</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Connection to SHM</h3>
<p data-cue="none">The equations for UCM are similar to the equations for Simple Harmonic Motion:</p>

<p class="TeX" data-cue="none">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{T^2}</p>
<p>The reason is that when an object is moving in a circle with constant speed, its <span class="TeX">x</span> and <span class="TeX">y</span> coordinates, viewed individually, will appear like SHM, and can be described by <span class="TeX">\sin</span> or <span class="TeX">\cos</span> functions...</p>
