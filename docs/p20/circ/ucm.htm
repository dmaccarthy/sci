<section class="Slide"><h3>Uniform Circular Motion</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Uniform circular motion</em> is motion along a <em>circular trajectory</em> with a <em>constant speed</em>.</p>
<ul><li>Because the <em>direction</em> of motion is always changing, the <em>velocity</em> is not constant.</li></ul>
<p>For motion along a circle, several new terms are commonly used to describe directions:</p>
<p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><svg data-svg2="p20/circ/img/ucm.js#earth" class="s16"/></p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Radial</em> (or “radially outward”) means the direction pointing directly away from the circle’s centre, at any point on the circumference.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Centripetal</em> (or “radially inward”) means the direction pointing directly toward from the circle’s centre, at any point on the circumference.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Tangential</em> means the along the circle’s circumference, perpendicular to the centripetal and radial directions.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Dynamics of UCM</h3>
<p>According to Newton’s Laws, an unbalanced force is required to change the direction of the velocity vector.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For uniform circular motion, the net force will always be in the <em>centripetal</em> direction.</li>
    <li>For example, Earth’s (nearly) circular orbit is caused by the Sun’s gravitational attraction.</li>
    <li>When scientists talk about “centripetal force”, they are only referring to the direction of the net force, not to the type of force.</li>
    <li>Centripetal force can be gravity (as in the Earth’s orbit), electric (as in the orbit of an electron in an atom), friction (as in a car rounding a curve), or any other type (or combination of types!) of force.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>UCM Relations</h3>
<p>The time that it takes an object to complete one full circular orbit is called the <em class="Defn">period</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>As for SHM, the symbol for period is a capital <span class="TeX">T</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="TeX">t</span>, which is the time coordinate.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Frequency</em> is the reciprocal of period: </li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">f=\frac{1}{T}</p>
<ul>
    <li>While period measures the time per cycle or obit, frequency measures the number of cycles per second.</li>
    <li>The SI unit of frequency is hertz (Hz = s<sup>–1</sup>).</li>
    <li>Frequency is sometimes measured in “rpm” (rotations per minute). To convert rpm to Hz, divide by 60 since Hz means rotations per second.</li>
    <li>Since the distance travelled each orbit is equal to the circumference of the circular orbit, <span class="TeX">2\pi r</span>, the period and the speed of the motion are related by the equation:</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}</p>
<ul><li>Note the similarity to the SHM equation:</li></ul>
<p class="TeX">v_{max}=\frac{2\pi A}{T}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A student stands on a carousel at a distance of 2.00 metres from the centre. Another student times the period of the motion to be 8.50 seconds. Calculate the speed of the student.</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \rm \frac{2\pi\cdot 2.00\ m}{8.50\ s} = 1.48\ m/s</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A car tire has a radius of 44.0 cm. Calculate the frequency and period of the rotation when the car is moving at 80.0 km/h.</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}</p>
<p class="TeX">vT = 2\pi r</p>
<p class="TeX">T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}</p>
<p class="TeX">T = \rm \frac{2\pi\cdot 0.440\ m}{22.2\ m/s} = 0.124\ s</p>
<p class="TeX">f = \frac{1}{T} = \rm{8.04\ Hz}</p>

    <li>Earth’s orbit around the Sun is very nearly circular. The period of Earth’s orbit is 365.24 days, and the orbital radius is 1.496 × 10<sup>11</sup> m.</li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Which force acts as the centripetal force for Earth’s motion?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The Sun’s gravity acting on the Earth is the centripetal force.</p>
    
        <li>Calculate Earth’s orbital speed.</li>
        <p class="TeX Answer">v = \frac{2\pi r}{T} = \rm \frac{2\pi \cdot 1.496\times 10^{11}\ m}{3.156\times 10^7\ s} = 2.979\times 10^4\ m/s</p>

    <li>A cyclist takes 15.2 seconds to complete one lap of a circular track. The bike is equipped with a speedometer that indicates the speed is 32.0 km/h.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Identify the force that causes the bike to move in circular motion.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Friction between the tires and the ground. This is the only unbalanced force because the normal force balances gravity on a flat surface.</p>

        <div class="Answer">
            <p class="TeX">v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}</p>

    <li>An electric generator contains a coil of copper wire that moves in a circle with <span class="TeX">r</span> = 25.0 cm. The generator rotates with a frequency of 3000 rpm (rotations per minute).
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Convert the frequency to the standard unit (hertz) and use the result to calculate the period of rotation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p class="TeX">f = \rm 3000\ \frac{rotations}{minute} = \frac{3000\ rotations}{60\ s} = 50.0\ Hz</p>

        <li>Define <em class="Defn">uniform circular motion</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Motion in a circular path with constant <em>speed</em>.</p>
    
        <li>Define: (i) <em class="Defn">radial</em>, (ii) <em class="Defn">centripetal</em>, (iii) <em class="Defn">tangential</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Radial is the direction directly away from the centre. Centripetal is toward the centre. Tangential means along the circumference, perpendiuclar to the radial and centripetal directions.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Using Newton’s Laws, explain why uniform circular motion can only occur when there is an unbalanced force.</li>
        <p class="Answer">If the unbalanced force was zero, the <em>direction</em> of the velocity (as well as the magnitude) would be constant; the motion would be a straight line.</p>

        <li>What is the direction of the net force for UCM?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Centripetal</p>

        <li>Explain how the speed of an object can be constant even though there is an unbalanced force.</li>
        <p class="Answer">The <em>direction</em> of the velocity is changing due to the force. Because the force acts perpendicular to the motion, it does zero work, so the speed remains constant.</p>

        <li>Define the <em class="Defn">period</em> of UCM.</li>
        <p class="Answer">The time for one complete circle.</p>

        <li>Define <em class="Defn">frequency</em> and explain how it relates to period.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Frequency (cycles per second) is the reciprocal of period (seconds per cycle).</p>

        <li>Define the SI unit of frequency. Explain how to convert between “rpm” and the standard unit.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Frequency is measured in hertz:</p>
