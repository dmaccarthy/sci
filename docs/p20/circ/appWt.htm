</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Apparent Weight</h3>
<p>We learned in an earlier lesson that the <em>sensation</em> of having weight is actually
    caused by the force or forces that balance gravity, often the normal force.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is because gravity acts uniformly over your entire body and does not create any stresses within your tissues that your body can sense.</li>
    <li>When you are accelerating, the forces acting on you are not balanced, so you may experience the sensation of having more (or less) apparent weight than usual.</li>
    <li>Because circular motion involves acceleration and therefore requires an unbalanced force, you may experience this effect when undergoing significant centripetal accelerations. This is what makes midway rides like roller coasters exciting.</li>
</ul>
<div>
    <p>Imagine you are at the top of a circular loop; for example, you might be riding your bike over a hill, or riding in a plane at the top of a circular climb.</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s12" data-svg2="p20/circ/img/appWt.js#loopy"></svg></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>The direction of the net force must be toward the centre, which in this example would be “down”. This means the magnitude of the upward (normal) force must be less than the downward force of gravity. As a result, you feel the sensation of reduced weight.</li>
    <li>When you are at the bottom of a circular loop, the centre of the circle, and therefore the direction of the net force, is “up”. This means that the magnitude of the upward normal force is greater than the downward force of gravity and you feel heavier than usual.</li>
    <li>To calculate your apparent weight, use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law: <p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\bf{a}}}_c</p></li>
    <li>Remember that <span class="TeX">{\vec{\bf F}}_{net} = {\vec{\bf F}}_g + {\vec{\bf F}}_n</span> is the vector sum of the forces.</li>
    <li>The magnitude of the acceleration vector for uniform circular motion must be: <p class="TeX">a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A roller coaster follows a track as illustrated. All curves have a radius of 5.00 metres. Calculate the apparent weight of a 50.0 kg passenger at the first and last points when the car has a speed of 6.00 m/s.</p>
<p data-cue="none" class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/circ/img/appWt.js#roller"></svg></p>
<div>
    <p>First calculate the centripetal acceleration:</p>
    <p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \rm \frac{(6.00\ m/s)^2}{5.00\ m} = 7.20\ m/s^2</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Now use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law to calculate the net force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">F_c = ma_c = \rm 50.0\ kg\cdot 7.20\ m/s^2 = 360\ N</p>
</div>
<p>The force and acceleration must be directed toward the centre, so the directions are negative at the left-most position and positive at the right.</p>
<div>
    <p>Calculate the force of gravity:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_g = m\vec{\bf g} = \rm 50.0\ kg\cdot (-9.81\ m/s^2) = -491\ N</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Finally solve for the normal force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = \vec{\bf F}_g + \vec{\bf F}_n</p>
    <p class="TeX">\begin{align}\vec{\bf F}_n &= \vec{\bf F}_{net} - \vec{\bf F}_g
\\ &= {\rm \pm 360\ N - (-491\ N)}
\end{align}</p>
</div>
<p>Using the negative sign gives +131 newtons for the normal force at the left position; the rider feels lighter than usual.</p>
<p>Using the positive sign gives +851 newtons for the normal force at the right position; the rider feels heavier than usual.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">How fast does the roller coaster have to be moving to become airborne at the first two points?</p>
<p data-cue="none" class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="p20/circ/img/appWt.js#roller"></svg></p>
<p>The rider becomes airborne and feels completely weightless when the normal force is zero.</p>
<p>When this happens, gravity is the only force and the acceleration is 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>This cannot happen on the right side because gravity is not directed toward the centre of the curve.</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p class="TeX">v = \sqrt{a_c r} = \rm \sqrt{9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 5.00\ m} = 7.00\ m/s</p>
<p>If the car has a speed slower than 7.00 m/s when it reaches the top of the loop, it will lose contact with the track and crash to the ground. Hopefully the ride was designed with safety features to prevent this from happening!</p>

    <li>Explain the difference between <em class="Defn">actual weight</em> and <em class="Defn">apparent weight</em>.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Actual weight refers to the force of gravity. Apparent weight refers to the forces that can be sensed, which usually means all forces <em>except</em> gravity.</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Under what circumstances will an object’s apparent weight be the same as its actual weight?	</li>
        <p class="Answer">When there is no acceleration, so that the forces balance.</p>

        <li>Explain how uniform circular motion can result in an apparent weight that is more or less than the actual weight. Why do we feel lighter when going over the top of a hill and heavier when going through the bottom of a valley?</li>
        <p class="Answer">For UCM, the object is always accelerating toward the centre. When gravity acts toward the centre, the apparent weight will be less, and when gravity acts away from the centre, the apparent weight will be more.</p>

        <li>How can we calculate the apparent weight when it differs from the actual weight?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The apparent weight will be the net (centripetal) force minus the actual weight (gravity force).</p>
