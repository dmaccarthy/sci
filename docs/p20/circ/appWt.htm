<section class="Slide"><h3>Apparent Weight</h3>
<p>We learned in an earlier lesson that the <em>sensation</em> of having weight is actually
    caused by the force or forces that balance gravity, often the normal force.</p>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>This is because gravity acts uniformly over your entire body and does not create any stresses within your tissues that your body can sense.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When you are accelerating, the forces acting on you are not balanced, so you may experience the sensation of having more (or less) apparent weight than usual.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">Because circular motion involves acceleration and therefore requires an unbalanced force, you may experience this effect when undergoing significant centripetal accelerations. This is what makes midway rides like roller coasters exciting.</li>
</ul>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>Imagine you are at the top of a circular loop; for example, you might be riding your bike over a hill, or riding in a plane at the top of a circular climb.</p>
    <p class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="p20/circ/img/appWt.png" class="w20 s16"/></p>
</div>
<ul data-cue="+">
    <li>The direction of the net force must be toward the centre, which in this example would be “down”. This means the magnitude of the upward (normal) force must be less than the downward force of gravity. As a result, you feel the sensation of reduced weight.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">When you are at the bottom of a circular loop, the centre of the circle, and therefore the direction of the net force, is “up”. This means that the magnitude of the upward normal force is greater than the downward force of gravity and you feel heavier than usual.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">To calculate your apparent weight, use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law: <p class="TeX">{\vec{\bf{F}}}_{net}=m{\vec{\bf{a}}}_c</p></li>
    <li data-cue="+">Remember that <span class="TeX">{\vec{\bf F}}_{net} = {\vec{\bf F}}_g + {\vec{\bf F}}_n</span> is the vector sum of the forces.</li>
    <li data-cue="+">The magnitude of the acceleration vector for uniform circular motion must be: <p class="TeX">a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p class="Blue">A roller coaster follows a track as illustrated. All curves have a radius of 5.00 metres. Calculate the apparent weight of a 50.0 kg passenger at the first and last points when the car has a speed of 6.00 m/s.</p>
<p class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="p20/circ/img/coaster.png" class="w20"/></p>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>First calculate the centripetal acceleration:</p>
    <p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \rm \frac{(6.00\ m/s)^2}{5.00\ m} = 7.20\ m/s^2</p>
</div>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>Now use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law to calculate the net force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">F_c = ma_c = \rm 50.0\ kg\cdot 7.20\ m/s^2 = 360\ N</p>
</div>
<p data-cue="+">The force and acceleration must be directed toward the centre, so the directions are negative at the left-most position and positive at the right.</p>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>Calculate the force of gravity:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_g = m\vec{\bf g} = \rm 50.0\ kg\cdot (-9.81\ m/s^2) = -491\ N</p>
</div>
<div data-cue="+">
    <p>Finally solve for the normal force:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = \vec{\bf F}_g + \vec{\bf F}_n</p>
    <p class="TeX">\begin{align}\vec{\bf F}_n &= \vec{\bf F}_{net} - \vec{\bf F}_g
\\ &= {\rm \pm 360\ N - (-491\ N)}
\end{align}</p>
</div>
<p data-cue="+">Using the negative sign gives +131 newtons for the normal force at the left position; the rider feels lighter than usual.</p>
<p data-cue="+">Using the positive sign gives +851 newtons for the normal force at the right position; the rider feels heavier than usual.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 2</h3>
<p class="Blue">How fast does the roller coaster have to be moving to become airborne at the first two points?</p>
<p class="Center"><img alt="Image" src="p20/circ/img/coaster.png" class="w20"/></p>
<p data-cue="+">The rider becomes airborne and feeels completely weightless when the normal force is zero.</p>
<p data-cue="+">When this happens, gravity is the only force and the acceleration is 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p data-cue="+">This cannot happen on the right side because gravity is not directed toward the centre of the curve.</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
<p data-cue="+" class="TeX">v = \sqrt{a_c r} = \rm \sqrt{9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 5.00\ m} = 7.00\ m/s</p>
<p data-cue="+">If the car has a speed slower than 7.00 m/s when it reaches the top of the loop, it will lose contact with the track and crash to the ground. Hopefully the ride was designed with safety features to prevent this from happening!</p>

        <li>What minimum speed must a roller coaster have to safely make it through a loop-the-loop that has a radius of 8.00 m?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The centripetal acceleration is provided by the normal and gravity forces combined. The least amount of acceleration occurs when the force is smallest which occurs when the normal force is zero. Since gravity is then the only force, the centripetal acceleration is 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">ra_c = v^2</p>

    <li>A 2.50 kg object is tied to the end of a 1.20 m long rope and spun in a vertical circle with a constant speed of 4.20 m/s. Calculate the tension force in the string when the object is at the (i) top and (ii) bottom of its trajectory. Include a free body diagram at both the top and bottom.</li>
<div class="Answer">
<p class="Center"><svg class="FBD s20" data-js="p20/circ/img/appWt#rope"></svg></p>
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = \rm{\frac{(4.20\ m/s)^2}{1.20\ m} = 14.7\ m/s^2}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf a}_c = \pm\rm{14.7\ m/s^2}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_g = m\vec{\bf g} = \rm{2.50\ kg\cdot (-9.81\ m/s^2) = -24.5\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = m\vec{\bf a}_c = \rm{2.50\ kg\cdot (\pm 14.7\ m/s^2) = \pm 36.8\ N}</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_{net} = \vec{\bf F}_g + \vec{\bf F}_t</p>
<p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}_t = \vec{\bf F}_{net} - \vec{\bf F}_g 
= \rm{\pm 36.8\ N - (-24.5\ N)}</p>
This evaluates to &ndash;12.2 newtons at the top and +61.3 newtons at the bottom.

    <li>For a low-gravity astronaut training mission, an airplane with a speed of 620 km/h goes into a climbing circular trajectory. The plane is required to remain upright at all times.

    <li>How much would a 2.08 kg book seem to weigh (i.e. what would the normal force be?) on a rotating space station if the rotational period was 45.0 s
        and the book was located 32.0 m from the space station’s axis of rotation? If an astronaut carried the book to the space station’s “upper” level (8.00 m from the rotational axis), what would its “weight” become? Include a free body diagram.</li>

    <li>A car speeds over the top of a circular hill with <span class="TeX">r</span> = 35.2 m. What is the maximum speed at which the car can travel without becoming airborne (losing contact with the ground)? Include a free body diagram.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The maximum speed would result in a normal force of zero, meaning that the acceleration would be <span class="TeX">g</span> since gravity is the only force acting on the car.
<p class="TeX">a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}</p>
<p class="TeX">a_c r = v^2</p>
