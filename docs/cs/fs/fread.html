<h3>“Reading” a Text File</h3>
<p>A <b class="Red">text file</b> is a file containing data encoded using a text encoding scheme such as ASCII or UTF-8. That is, the sequence of binary data (0’s and 1’s) contained in the file represents a sequence of characters.  Python provides a built-in function named <code>open</code> that you can use to access text files...</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy"><span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

text = open("myData.txt", encoding="UTF-8")
for line in text:
    print(line.rstrip())
text.close()</pre>
<p>The first argument of the <code>open</code> function is the absolute or relative path of the file to be opened. The keyword argument <code>encoding</code> identifies the codec that Python is to use to decode the information in the file. You should use the <code>"UTF-8"</code> codec most of the time.</p>
<p>When you open a file, Python and/or your operating system handle much of the work involved in accessing the data such as buffering (deciding when and how much of the file data to load into RAM) and decoding (converting the binary data into <code>str</code> instances).</p>
<p>In Python, text files are iterable. You can loop through an open file with each iteration operating on a single line of text. Text files use a special character or series of characters to separate one line from the next. When Python reads a line of text, the end-of-line character(s) are included as part of the str object produced. In the example above, the <code>rstrip</code> method is used to remove the end-of-line characters (and any other trailing whitespace) from the <code>str</code> instances.</p>
<p>When you have finished with a file, you must call the <code>close</code> method to free up any resources being used to access the file.</p>

<h3>Python’s with-as Statement</h3>
<p>Python provides a special <code>with-as</code> statement for objects (like files) that have a “clean-up” procedure.  In the case of file instances, the clean-up procedure is to close the file.</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy"><span class="Comment"># Example 2...</span>

with open("myData.txt", encoding="UTF-8") as text:
    for line in text:
        print(line.rstrip())</pre>
<p>As in the previous example, the file instance is created with the <code>open</code> function and assigned a name (<code>text</code>). However, rather than using a normal assignment statement, the <code>with-as</code> statement is used instead. When Python reaches the end of the indented block following the <code>with-as</code> statement it runs the instance’s clean-up procedure (i.e. close the file) automatically.</p>
<p>You should use the <code>with-as</code> statement whenever you can with <code>open</code> to ensure that you do not accidentally forget to close your files.  This will also close the file if an exception occurs while reading the file.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>A word guessing game like Hangman requires a collection of clues and answers for the player to guess. These puzzles could be stored in a text file like this...</p>
<pre class="IO">80's Movie#Raiders of the Lost Ark
Sports Team#Toronto Raptors
Canadian City#Halifax, Nova Scotia</pre>
<p>The program would need to read the file contents, separate each line into a (clue, answer) tuple or list, and return a list. The text input above should result in the list...</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy">[("80's Movie", "Raiders of the Lost Ark"),
    ("Sports Team", "Toronto Raptors"),
    ("Canadian City", "Halifax, Nova Scotia")]</pre>
<ol>
    <li>Complete the <code>program f02_clues.py</code> to read in the file contents and process the data as described above. The program should ignore any lines that contain invalid data.</li>
    <li>Complete the program, <code>f02_compare.py</code>, that prompts the user to enter two text file names and then compares the files to see if they contain identical data. While it is possible to read the files in their entirety, large files will require a lot of your computer’s memory. It is better to compare the file contents line by line. Add a few text files to the folder to test with.</li>
</ol>
