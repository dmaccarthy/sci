<h3>Writing Text Files</h3>

<p>Python’s <code>open</code> function defaults to read-only mode: it assumes that the file exists and that you want to access but not modify the data.  To create a new text file, you must open the file in <b class="Red">write mode</b>. To do this, add the argument <code>"w"</code> (write mode) after the file path when calling open...</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy"><span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

from os.path import exists

data = "Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"
filename = "myData.txt"
if exists(filename):
    print("The file already exists!")
else:
    with open(filename, <span class="Blue">"w"</span>, encoding="UTF-8") as text:
        for line in data:
            text.<span class="Blue">write</span>(line + "\n")
    print("Finished writing {}.".format(filename))</pre>

<p>Opening a file in write mode will erase all data in the file if the file already exists. You can use the <code>os.path.exists</code> function to check whether or not the file exists before attempting to open it in write mode. Use the <code>write</code> method to add data to the file.</p>
<p>Python also provides an <b class="Red">append</b> mode. This prevents the data in the file from being erased; new data is always appended to the end of the existing file...</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy"><span class="Comment"># Example 2...</span>

data = "Line 4", "Line 5", "Line 6"
filename= "myData.txt"
with open(filename, <span class="Blue">"a"</span>, encoding="UTF-8") as text:
    for line in data:
        text.write(line + "\n")
print("Finished appending to {}.".format(filename))</pre>

<p>See the <a target="py_doc" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open">Python documentation</a> for a complete list of supported file modes.</p>

<h3>JSON, CSV, XML</h3>
<p>One issue that a programmer must deal with, is how to structure the data in a file so that it can be written, read, and modified easily and efficiently. Here is an example of a text file containing data for a Contacts program. Note that it uses the text <code>[Contact]</code> to mark the beginning of a new contact, a blank line to mark the end of a contact, and once piece of data per line in the format <em>field:value</em>.</p>
<pre class="IO">[Contact]
surname:MacCarthy
email:dmaccarthy@eips.ca
address:Room 133, 20 Festival Way
city:Sherwood Park, AB
phone:780-467-8816
details:Comp Sci Teacher

[Contact]
surname:Doe
givenName:Jane
email:janedoe@gmail.com</pre>

<p>Over the years, programmers have developed a number of widely used formats for structuring text data. The most commonly used such formats include Javascript Object Notation (JSON), eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and Comma Separated Values (CSV).</p>
<p>One of the major advantages of using these formats is that programming languages (including Python) often support these formats. This means that you as a programmer do not have to design your own text file structure and write the subprograms that will save and load the data.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that a widely-known and supported data format makes it easier to exchange data between different programs, even programs written in different languages. JSON and XML are both widely used on the Web, for example, while CSV is used for exchanging data tables with spreadsheet programs such as Excel, LibreOffice, and Google Sheets.</p>
<p>XML and its relative HTML are the topics of their own course in the Computing Science program. Here, we will focus only on JSON.</p>
<p>“Javascript Object Notation” gets its name from the Javascript programming language upon which it is based. This notation is very similar to Python dictionaries.  The Python standard library includes a <code>json</code> module that includes functions for saving and loading dictionaries as JSON files. (You can also save non-dictionary data but the resulting file may not be compatible with other JSON parsers.)</p>
<p>The example below places the Contacts data in a dictionary and calls the function <code>json.dump</code> to save the JSON-encoded data as a text file...</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="copy"><span class="Comment"># Example 3...</span>

import json

<span class="Comment">Place the data in dictionaries...</span>

contact1 = {"surname":"MacCarthy", "email":"dmaccarthy@eips.ca",
    "address":"Room 133, 20 Festival Way", "city":"Sherwood Park, AB",
    "Phone":"780-467-8816", "details":"Comp Sci Teacher"}

contact2 = {"surname":"Doe", "givenName":"Jane",
    "email":"janedoe@gmail.com"}

<span class="Comment"># Dump (save) the dictionary as a JSON file...</span>

allContacts = {"contacts":[contact1, contact2]}
with open("contacts.json", "w", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    json.dump(allContacts , f, ensure_ascii=False)

<span class="Comment"># Reload the JSON file...</span>

with open("contacts.json", encoding="UTF-8") as f:
    print(json.load(f)["contacts"])</pre>

<p>When using <code>json.dump</code> with UTF-8 encoded text files, set the <code>ensure_ascii</code> keyword argument to <code>False</code>. Otherwise, all non-ASCII characters will be escaped.</p>
<p>The dictionary being saved should use strings as keys and can contain values that are strings, numbers (<code>int</code> or <code>float</code>), or Boolean values. The values can also be dictionaries or lists, provided that the items are types that are compatible with the JSON format.</p>
<p>For example, a dictionary containing a date instance will raise an exception since date instances cannot be exported as JSON.  (You can explicitly convert the date instance to a <code>str</code> or list to save it as JSON.) You can use tuples in your data, but they will converted to lists when dumped.</p>
<p>The <code>json.load</code> function will load a JSON file as a Python dictionary. See the Python documentation for more detailed information about the <a target="py_json" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json"><code>json</code></a>, <code>csv</code> and <code>xml</code> modules.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Complete the program <code>f03_merge.py</code> to merge several text files into a single file.</p>
        <p>The function <code>askFileNames</code> is a <em>generator</em> that should prompt the user to enter the names of the files being merged. The user can enter as many files as he or she wants. When the user enters a blank line, the function should confirm that there are no more files to be merged.</p>
        <p>The function <code>appendFile</code> appends the new file (the second argument) to the output file (the first argument). The function must ensure that the output file does not already exist the first time it is called (third argument will be <code>True</code>).</p>
        <p>The program must handle exceptions without crashing; for example, if the user types the name of a file that does not exist or for which he or she does not have permission to open the file.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Complete the program, <code>f03_teams.py</code>, to keep track of the records of teams in a sports league. First write the <code>saveData</code> function so that the data structure will be saved when the program terminates. Next, modify the <code>loadData</code> function so that the data can be reloaded when the program is run a second time. Finally, complete the <code>editTeam</code> function to display the team information in a user-friendly way, and to allow the user to modify the team’s record and/or change the name of the team.</li>
</ol>
