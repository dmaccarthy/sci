<h3>Project</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Login to <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a> with your EIPS Google account. Then open this <a href="https://replit.com/@DavidMacCarthy/Java">Java repl</a> and create your own fork. Invite your teacher as a collaborator.</li>
    <li>Open this free <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp"><em>Java Tutorial</em></a>. Work through the tutorial lessons up to and including <em>Java Exceptions</em>. You do not need to install Java since it is already installed on repl.it. Copy the example programs into your repl.it project and make sure that they run correctly.</li>
    <li>Once you are fluent in Java, see your teacher for a summative programming task.</li>
    <li>Next, you will use your knowledge of Java to complete a programming project on a topic of interest to you. The topic must be something not already covered in the CSE courses. Make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tideT0Ypr662oXzHNLBOG7vI-TiH_1HRHrQJYrpyuJE"><em>Project Template</em></a>. Complete the template and let your teacher know you are ready to begin the project. The teacher will provide feedback/approval before you begin.</li>
    <li>Complete the project in repl.it using object-oriented programming techniques in Java. Let your teacher know when you have finished the project.</li>
