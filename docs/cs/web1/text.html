<h3>Text Nodes</h3>
<div class="Note">
<p>XML supports several other types of nodes in addition to element nodes. As we have already learned,
	an <em>element node</em> is represented by a tag that contains a tag name (mandatory), and
	attributes* (optional). A self-closing tag can be used for elements that have no child nodes, while
	paired start- and end-tags must be used if the element does have child nodes. (*Technically,
	attributes are considered to be a node type separate from the element nodes that contain them!
	However, we are not going to pursue this distinction at this stage of instruction.)</p>

<p>Another type of node that can be included in XML documents is a <em class="Defn">text node</em>.
	As the name suggests, text nodes contain only text. Text nodes do not use tags, and therefore have
	no tag name, no attributes, and no child nodes. Consider the two <code>Country</code> element nodes
	in this examples...</p>

<pre class="Code" data-echo="xml" contenteditable="true">&lt;Examples&gt;
  &lt;Country name="Canada" capital="Ottawa" /&gt;
  &lt;Country capital="Ottawa"&gt;<span class="Blue">Canada</span>&lt;/Country&gt;
&lt;/Examples&gt;</pre>

<p>Both examples are valid XML, and both contain (almost) the same information. The difference is that
	the second example includes the country name (“Canada”) as a child <em>text node</em>, while the
	first example includes it as an <em>attribute</em> of the element node instead. When data is placed
	in a text node, it does not need to be enclosed in quotes like attributes do. The XML parser will
	recognize text data by the fact that it is not part of a tag.</p>

<p>Of these two methods of encoding the data, the first example is better, because it tells the reader
	explicitly that “Canada” is the name of the <code>Country</code>. A human reader would likely be able
	to figure this out for the second example too, but computer programs only know what is actually
	encoded in the computer’s memory. You should use attributes to encode small quantities of text data
	(i.e. text that is much smaller than a single line on the computer monitor) while using text nodes
	for larger quantities, such as a complete paragraph from a novel or essay...</p>

<pre class="Code" data-echo="xml" contenteditable="true">&lt;Novel title="A Christmas Carol" subtitle="A Ghost Story of Christmas" author="Charles Dickens" year="1843"&gt;
    &lt;Chapter number="Stave I" title="Marley's Ghost"&gt;
        &lt;Paragraph number="1"&gt;Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;
        &lt;Paragraph number="2"&gt;Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.&lt;/Paragraph&gt;
        <span class="Green">&lt;!-- More paragraphs go here... --&gt;</span>
    &lt;/Chapter&gt;
    <span class="Green">&lt;!-- More chapters go here... --&gt;</span>
&lt;/Novel&gt;</pre>

</div>

<h3>Comment Nodes</h3><div class="Note">
<div class="Note">

<p>Another feature of XML is <em class="Defn">comment node</em>. In computer programming, a “comment”
	refers to text that is intended only for human readers and is to be ignored by programs that read
	the code. For example, you might want to explain something when the purpose of the source code isn’t
	clear, or you might want to make notes to yourself while you are writing your source code without
	having your notes cause the program to behave in an undesirable way.</p>

<p>In XML, comments are enclosed in tags just as element nodes are. Instead of using a tag name, a
	special sequence of symbols is used to identify comments...</p>

<pre class="Code" data-echo="xml" contenteditable="true">&lt;ElementNode data="Some Text"&gt;
    This is a text node!
    <span class="Green">&lt;!-- This is a comment node --&gt;</span>
&lt;/ElementNode &gt;
<span class="Green">&lt;!-- This is another comment node --&gt;</span></pre>

<p>Note that the characters <code>!--</code> appear immediately after the less than symbol
	(<code>&lt;</code>) to identify the beginning of the comment’s tag, and the characters <code>--</code>
	appear at the end of the tag, immediately before the greater than symbol (<code>&gt;</code>).

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>Use text nodes to encode any text data that could be longer than a few words.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a well-formed XML document <code>w04_Mary.xml</code> to encode the poem
		<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46954/mary-had-a-little-lamb" target="Mary">Mary
		Had a Little Lamb</a> using XML.</li>
	<li>When a user submits a form on a website, the data is sent to a server where it may be saved as
		an XML document. Create an XML document <code>w04_form.xml</code> that contains the data from the
		following form...</li>
</ol>
<table class="Auto TD">
    <tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td>John Von Neumann</td><td><b>Age</b></td><td>16</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>Sherwood Park</td><td><b>Grade</b></td><td>11</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>Comment</b></td><td colspan="3">I love Computing Science! It's my favourite subject by far. I'm going to be a computer scientist -- or maybe an applied mathematician -- after university.</td></tr>
