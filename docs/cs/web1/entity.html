<h3>XML Entities</h3>
<div class="Note">
<p>Suppose we wanted to encode the following math statements as an XML document...</p>

<pre class="IO">
x = 7
y = 5
y &lt; x</pre>

<p>We might create a document something like this...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;Math&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;x = 7&lt;/Statement&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;y = 5&lt;/Statement&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;y <span class="Blue">&lt;</span> x&lt;/Statement&gt;
&lt;/Math&gt;</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this code will not work. If you attempt to preview the XML, your web browser (or any
	other XML parsing program) will be confused by the less-than symbol (<code>&lt;</code>) in the last
	<code>Statement</code> element. Since XML uses the less-than and greater-than symbols to mark the
	tags, these symbols cannot be used in the data, tag names, or attribute names or values. To solve
	this problem, XML uses the concept of an <em class="Defn">entity</em>. Compare the following XML code...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;Math&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;x = 7&lt;/Statement&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;y = 5&lt;/Statement&gt;
  &lt;Statement&gt;y <span class="Blue">&amp;lt;</span> x&lt;/Statement&gt;
&lt;/Math&gt;</pre>

<p>The sequence of characters <code>&amp;lt;</code> is the less-than entity. It tells the XML parser
	that we want to include a less-than symbol, but it does so without using the symbol itself. The
	program will now be able to identify the tags and the data correctly. After it has made sense of the
	document, it will replace the less-than entity (<code>&amp;lt;</code>) by the symbol it represents
	(<code>&lt;</code>) and display the document the way we want it to. The entity for the greater-than
	symbol (<code>&gt;</code>) is <code>&amp;gt;</code>.</p>

<p>All entities begin with an ampersand (<code>&</code>) and end with a semicolon (<code>;</code>).
	The characters in between identify which entity we want. While using entities for the <code>&lt;</code>
	and <code>&gt;</code> symbols solves one problem, it creates another; XML parsers will expect an
	entity whenever they see an ampersand symbol! Look at the following XML...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;TV_Shows&gt;
    &lt;Show&gt;Law <span class="Blue">&amp;</span> Order: SVU&lt;/Show&gt;
&lt;/TV_Shows&gt;</pre>

<p>When the program encounters the <code>&amp;</code> symbol it will expect an entity. Since there is
	no entity in the data, the program will become confused and report an error. We need to use an
	entity (<code>&amp;amp;</code>) for the ampersand symbol...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;TV_Shows&gt;
    &lt;Show&gt;Law <span class="Blue">&amp;amp;</span> Order: SVU&lt;/Show&gt;
&lt;/TV_Shows&gt;</pre>

<p>Other XML entities are the apostrophe (<code>&amp;apos;</code>) and the double quotation mark
	(<code>&amp;quot;</code>).</p>

</div>

<h3>XML Declaration &amp; Document Type</h3><div class="Note">

<p>When you edit an XML document you may notice that a line like the
	following appears before the root element...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Root/&gt;</pre>

<p>This is an optional <em class="Defn">XML declaration</em> or <em class="Defn">prolog</em>. This line
	instructs the XML parser which version of XML to use when parsing the document, and which character
	encoding set is used in the file. You must ensure that the declared encoding matches the actual
	encoding. For example, if your text editor saves the file as ASCII but you declare the encoding as
	UTF-16, some programs may not be able to the read the document properly.</p>

<p>XML also allows you to include a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> tag between the XML declaration and the
	root node tag. This <em class="Defn">document type declaration</em> (DTD) lets you describe your document’s
	rules for allowed tag names and attribute names, and can be used to define new entities. Unfortunately,
	DTD’s are beyond the scope of this lesson.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Final Note...</h3><div class="Note">

<p>When coding an XML document, you are encouraged to first make a template before entering any actual
	data...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="xml">
&lt;Country name="" capital=""&gt;
    &lt;Province name="" capital=""&gt;
        &lt;Municipality name="" type=""&gt;
            &lt;Community name="" /&gt;
        &lt;/Municipality&gt;
    &lt;/Province&gt;
&lt;/Country&gt;</pre>

<p>The template shows which tag names and attribute names you intend to use, which attributes go with
	which tags, and what the parent-child relationships will be between nodes. Once you’ve tested and
	validated your template, you can use cut-and-paste to duplicate each part of the data tree as many
	times as you need to before entering your data.</p>

<p>This will reduce the time-consuming requirement to track down errors caused by typos and it will
	ensure that you use the same spelling and case for tag and attribute names every time. This is
	important because XML is case-sensitive. For example, if a program searches for tags named
	<code>Municipality</code> with an attribute <code>name</code>, it will skip over tags named
	<code>municipality</code> and attributes called <code>Name</code>.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p style="margin-top:0">You have been hired by a TV listings publisher to design an XML document to encode the TV
			listings. Use <a href="https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings" target="Data">this link</a> to see the
			data your employer wants to encode.</p>
		<p>You do not need to encode the entire document (they have data entry specialists for that!) but
			you do need to demonstrate the design of the document by encoding the listings for <u>any two
			channels</u> over a <u>three hour time period</u>. Note that you will be expected to encode not only the
			information visible in the listings but also the additional information that is displayed when
			you click on an TV program.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0">First, create and validate a template for your document, <code>w05_template.xml</code>. The
			template will show all the tag and attribute names but will not contain any actual data.
			Next, duplicate the template as <code>w05_listings.xml</code> and add the data for your selected
			channels and time period. Be sure that it displays correctly in a your web browser.</p>
