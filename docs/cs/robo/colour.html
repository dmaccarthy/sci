<h3>Colour Sensors</h3><div class="Note">
<p>The gyroscope is only one of the sensors that the <code>sc8pr</code> robot is equipped with.
    The robot also has two colour sensors, one pointed to the front and one pointed down. The
    robot’s “eyes” illustrate the colours detected by the most recent sensor update.</p>
<p>You can access the colour data using <code>robot.sensorFront</code> and <code>robot.sensorDown</code>.
    The colour sensor data is only updated when your <code>brain</code> function requests it,
    so you must call the <code>robot.updateSensors</code> function before checking the sensor colours.</p>

<h3>RGBA Colour</h3><div class="Note">
<p>You may notice that the output of the program above is a pair of numerical sequences of four numbers, such as
    <code><span class="Black">(128, 200, 34, 255)</span></code>. Computer hardware often uses “RGBA” codes to represent colours.
    “RGBA” stands for red, green, blue, and alpha. Essentially, the computer hardware creates colors by
    combining red, green, and blue lights. In the image below we can see that the red and blue spotlights
    produce a “magenta” shade of purple when they overlap. Overlapping red and green produce yellow; and
    overlapping blue and green produce “cyan”. Where all three lights overlap, the result is white.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#/media/File:RGB_illumination.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/RGB_illumination.jpg" alt="Image"/></a></p>
<p>Other colours and shades can be produced by changing the brightness of one or more of the lights.
    You can visit <a href="../../tools/color/">this page</a> to see how RGB
    colours are produced. Alternatively, you can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">WikiPedia</a>
    for a list of named colours and their corresponding RGB codes.</p>
<p>RGB colours are usually represented either as percentages, or on a scale of 0 to 255. Our programs
    will use the latter. The “A” in RGBA is for alpha. This fourth value represents the <b class="Red">opacity</b>
    of the colour. A value of 0 means that the colour is totally transparent; 255 is completely opaque;
    and 128 is about 50% transparent. Although you may be using transparency later in Computing Science,
    the robot colour sensors cannot detect transparency, so the final value in the RGBA code will always be 255.</p>
</div>

<h3>HSVA Colour</h3><div class="Note">
<p>The RGB colour model is useful because it is how computer hardware actually represents and produces
    colour, but it is not especially suited to how humans perceive colour.</p>
<p> This <b class="Red">colour wheel</b> illustrates a continuum of colours:</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="robo/img/wheel.png" alt="Wheel"/></p>
<p>At the far right, you will find the colour red. As you move clockwise around the outside of the circle,
    the colour gradually changes to yellow (at 60°), then green (at 120°), cyan (at 180°), etc. As you
    move toward the centre of the circle, the colour passes through various different shades before
    eventually fading to white at the centre.</p>
<p>Each colour on the colour wheel can be described by a <b class="Red">hue</b> (a number between 0 and
    360 that represents the angle) and a <b class="Red">saturation</b> (a number between 0 and 100
    representing how far from the centre the colour is). For example blue, which is represented as
    <code><span class="Black">(0, 0, 255)</span></code> in RGB, has a hue of 240 and a saturation of 100.</p>
<p>The colour wheel above is shown at maximum brightness. You can imagine “dimming” the colour wheel to
    produce darker shades of colour. The overall brightness of the colour wheel is represented by a third
    number, called the <b class="Red">value</b> (or sometimes <b class="Red">brightness</b>) that
    is between 0 and 100. The colour wheel above has a value of 100. Taken together, the hue, saturation,
    and value numbers (HSV) make an alternative way of representing colours.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation where a robot wants to locate a “blue” object in one of its colour sensors.
    One problem is that the object may not have uniform colour. Another is that the RGB value detected
    by the sensor will depend on lighting and shadows. A third problem is that “noise” in the colour
    sensor may cause the sensor reading to be a bit off. If our robot’s brain waits until its sensor
    detects the exact colour “blue” – <code><span class="Black">(0, 0, 255)</span></code> in the RGB
    model – it will not be able to “see” the object reliably. What we can do instead, is to convert
    the colour sensor data to an HSV representation, and then define a <em>range</em> which is acceptably blue.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="robo/img/blue.png" alt="Wheel (Blue)"/></p>
<p>The “box” drawn on the colour wheel above identifies colours with a hue between 205 and 260, and a
    saturation between 60 and 100. We can take these criteria as our definition of what our robot will
    consider to be “blue”. We might also want to specify a minimum brightness value, since the blue
    colour fades to black if the “V” part of HSV becomes too small. Note that colours close to the
    boundary of the box may not be detected reliably if the sensor is noisy.</p>
<p>The fourth number in HSVA, like in RGBA, is the alpha value that describes opacity. As we saw above,
    the RGBA alpha values use a scale from 0 to 255. In HSVA, the alpha scale goes from 0 (transparent)
    to 100 (opaque). Here is the program from above, modified to display colours as HSVA. Note that
    RGBA is the default colour model. If you want to print a colour in HSVA format, you must add <code>.hsva</code>
    to the end of the expression.</p>
<p><code>sc8pr</code> has a function called <code>hsvBox</code> that will check is a colour falls within
    a range of HSV values. We could write a function to check if a colour is blue, as defined by the box in
    the illustration.</p>
<p>In the example below, the keyword <code>return</code> is a Python instruction that sends a result
    from a function back to the function or program that called it. In this example the result will be
    either <code>True</code> (the colour is blue) or <code>False</code> (the colour is not blue.)</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Copy your <code>turnTo</code> function from <code>r03_turn.py</code> into the program below. Add a function
