<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<p>Complete each of these challenges using only the robot sensors and actuators. Do not access or modify the simulation code or reconfigure the robot’s sensors.</p>

<li>Teach the robot how to follow the <em>edge</em> of the blue line by completing the <code>followLine</code> function.
    To do this, the robot needs to move forward when it’s on the <em>edge</em> of the line, turn in
    one direction when it’s on the <em>centre</em> of the line, and turn in the opposite direction
    when it’s off the line completely. When it’s on the <em>edge</em>, the colour sensor will detect
    bluish-white, which will have the same H and V values as ordinary blue, but a smaller S value.

</li>
<li>Duplicate your program <code>r07_line1.py</code> as <code>r07_line2.py</code>. Modify the
    <code>followLine</code> function so that it takes a second argument which tells it how long to follow the
    line. For example, if the program calls <code>followLine(robot, 5)</code>, the robot should
    follow the line for five seconds and then stop. You can use the robot’s built-in timer
    (<code>robot.uptime</code>) to accomplish this.</li>
<li>Duplicate your program <code>r07_line2.py</code> as <code>r07_line3.py</code>. Create a new
    function called <code>followToEnd</code> that follows the line until it reaches one of the
    ends. You can do this by monitoring the robot’s gyroscope. The example below calls
    <code>robot.gyroSample(3)</code> to monitor the gyroscope for three seconds at a time. The
    expression <code>robot.gyroChange</code> will indicate by how many degrees this reading has changed
    over the last three seconds. The gryroscope should change by very little when moving along the line
    and by a much larger amount when it turns around at the end.

    while robot.active:
        robot.updateSensors()
        print(robot.gyroChange)

</li>
<li>Finally, make a program <code>r07_park.py</code> that parks the robot in an unoccupied space. To
    avoid colliding with another robot, you can use the robot’s proximity sensor (<code>robot.proximity</code>)
    which indicates how far away the nearest obstacle is.</li>
