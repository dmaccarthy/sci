<h3>Gyroscope Sensor</h3><div class="Note">
<p>In the previous assignment, you made the robot draw a letter on the floor of the arena. You probably used trial and error to determine how long to run the motors to execute a given stroke or turn. One problem with this approach is that it does not give reliable results. For a real robot, running the motors on full power may produce different outcomes depending on whether the robot is on concrete, mud, ice, or grass. It can also depend on whether the robot’s power supply is fully charged or partly depleted.</p>
<p>A better method is to rely on the robot’s <b class="Red">sensors</b> to decide when to stop the motors. The <code>sc8pr</code> robot simulation has a sensor called <code>gyro</code> (gyroscope) that indicates the direction the robot is pointing.</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 'r02_ex1.py'</span>

from sc8pr.robot.arena import Arena
from sc8pr.geom import angleDifference

def brain(robot):
    robot.motors = 0.2, -0.2   <span class="Comment"># Spin in place</span>
    while robot.active:        <span class="Comment"># Loop until simulation ends</span>
        robot.updateSensors()  <span class="Comment"># Update the sensor readings</span>
        gyro = robot.gyro      <span class="Comment"># Get gyro reading</span>
        diff = angleDifference(gyro, 45.0)
        print(f"{gyro:7.2f} {diff:7.2f}")

Arena.run(brain)    <span class="Comment"># Run the simulation</span></pre>
<p>For the arena simulation, the gyroscope has been calibrated so that <code>robot.gyro</code> will be <code>0</code> when the robot points right, <code>90</code> when it points to the bottom of the screen, <code>180</code> when it points left, and <code>270</code> when it points to the top.
    When the gyroscope reading reaches <code>360</code>, it resets to <code>0</code>. Other simulations may calibrate the gyroscope differently or not at all.</p>
<p><code>sc8pr</code> has an <code>angleDifference</code> function that we can use to calculate how far away the robot is from its desired direction. Suppose we want to orient the robot to 45° (diagonally down and right).
    This expression will tell us how far, and in what direction, the robot is from 45°:</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code">angleDifference(gyro, 45.0)</pre>
<p>When the robot is close to the correct direction, the <code>angleDifference</code> will be close to <code>0</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Sensor Loop</h3><div class="Note">
<p>The example above uses a loop with the condition <code>robot.active</code>. This will be <code>True</code> as long as the simulation is running. When the simulation is closed <code>robot.active</code> will become <code>False</code>, causing the loop to end and the robot <code>brain</code> to terminate.</p>
<p>When running a loop, it is important to call <code>robot.updateSensors()</code>. This will ensure that the sensor data is current, and will also prevent the robot brain from using too much CPU power (which could cause the simulation to run slowly).</p>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Make a copy of the example program as <code>r02_spin.py</code>. Modify the program so that the robot asks the user to enter an angle and the robot will then spin in place to the requested direction and stop.
    You can call the function <code>robot.numinput</code> to get input from the user. Also, you will not be able to make the gyro reading <em>exactly</em> equal (to 16 decimal places!) to the direction you want to point the robot.
        You will need to decide on how close is “close enough”; within 1 degree or maybe 0.1 degree? The faster the robot is spinning, the less accurate it will be in orienting itself to the desired direction.</li>
<li>Copy your program from the previous question into <code>r02_turn.py</code>. Modify the program so that the user can specify the left and right motor settings as well as the direction for the robot to stop. This will allow the robot to move while it turns instead of just spinning in place.</li>
</ol>
