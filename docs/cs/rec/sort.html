<p>In the <a href="#iter">Iterative Algorithms</a> course, you learned about several sorting algorithms such as the bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.  Recursion allows for several additional algorithms...</p>

<h3>Merge Sort</h3><div class="Note">

<p>Suppose we have a sequence of unsorted data, letâ€™s say 15 numbers...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">[9, 86, 35, 23, 32, 11, 54, 82, 172, 43, 19, 147, 49, 84, 27]</pre>
<p>A merge sort algorithm splits the list into two smaller lists.  Since there are an odd number of items, one sublist will have seven items and the other will have eight...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">[9, 86, 35, 23, 32, 11, 54] [82, 172, 43, 19, 147, 49, 84, 27]</pre>
<p>Next we sort the two lists...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">[9, 11, 23, 32, 35, 54, 86] [19, 27, 43, 49, 82, 84, 147, 172]</pre>
<p>Finally we merge the two sorted sublists back into a single list.  We do this by comparing the first items in each list and selecting the smaller value.  We then repeat this (iteratively) until all items from both lists have been selected and copied into the final sorted list.</p>
<p>The recursive step occurs when we need to sort the sublists.  We do this by calling the merge sort function on each of the two sublists.  This will split each of those lists into two even smaller lists to be sorted (recursively) and then merged.  Recursion will continue to split the sublists into even smaller lists until eventually there is only one item in the list.  This is the base case: a list of one item does not need to be sorted and is ready to merge with another list.</p>
</div>

<h3>Quick Sort</h3><div class="Note">

<p>The quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm.  With the merge sort, the data is copied and recopied whenever a list is split into sublists and again when the sublists are merged into a sorted list.  With the quicksort, items within the list are switched but no lists or sub-lists are copied.  This means that the quicksort usually requires less memory than the merge sort.</p>
<p>The quicksort operates by repeatedly <b class="Red">partitioning</b> a portion of the list. Suppose that variables <code>left</code>
    and <code>right</code> are indices identifying the portion of the list to be partitioned. The algorithm starts
    by choosing a random value from within this part of the list which is called the <b class="Red">pivot</b>.  In the list below, the indices are 0 and 6 (shown in red and including the entire list) and the pivot is 32 (blue).</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO"><span class="Red">23</span>, 86, 35, 9, <span class="Blue">32</span>, 54, <span class="Red">11</span></pre>
<p>The algorithm increments the <code>left</code> index (if necessary) until it points to a value that is greater
    than or equal to the pivot, while decrementing right (if necessary) until it points to a value less than or
    equal to the pivot...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">23, <span class="Red">86</span>, 35, 9, <span class="Blue">32</span>, 54, <span class="Red">11</span></pre>
<p>Now it switches the values that the indices point to...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">23, <span class="Red">11</span>, 35, 9, <span class="Blue">32</span>, 54, <span class="Red">86</span>  <span class="Comment"># Switched 11 and 86</span></pre>
<p>Now we continue incrementing and decrementing the indices until we find more values to switch.</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="IO">23, 11, <span class="Red">35</span>, 9, <span class="Blue">32</span>, <span class="Red">54</span>, 86
23, 11, <span class="Red">35</span>, 9, <span class="Red">32</span>, 54, 86
23, 11, <span class="Blue">32</span>, 9, <span class="Red">35</span>, 54, 86  <span class="Comment"># Switched 32 and 35</span>
23, 11, <span class="Red">32</span>, <span class="Red">9</span>, 35, 54, 86
23, 11, <span class="Red">9</span>, <span class="Blue">32</span>, 35, 54, 86  <span class="Comment"># Switched 9 and 32</span>
23, 11, 9, <span class="Red">32</span>, 35, 54, 86  <span class="Comment"># Indices are now equal!</span></pre>
<p>In some cases, the pivot may appear in the data set more than once. If the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>
    indices are unequal but both point to the pivot value, increment <code>left</code> without switching the values.</p>
<p>Once <code>left == right</code>, the list is partitioned! In the example above, the indices both end with values
    of \(3\). All of the values with indices less than this are less than or equal to the pivot \((23, 11, 9)\),
    and all of the values with indices greater than \(3\) are greater than or equal to the pivot \((35, 54, 86)\).
    The data that corresponds to the final index values will be the pivot value.</p>
<p>Now comes the recursive part of the algorithm: we call our quicksort function again to partition the left half
    of the data, using \(0\) (the original <code>left</code>) and \(2\) (the final <code>left - 1</code>) as the indices.
    We also call the quicksort to partition the right half of the data, with indices of \(4\) (the final <code>right + 1</code>)
    and \(6\) (the original <code>right</code>). The base case occurs when quicksort is called with the same value
    for <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>, in which case nothing needs to be done.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>All programs require the use of good programming techniques, including:</p><ul>
<li>Internal documentation (docstrings and comments)</li>
<li>Descriptive variable names</li>
<li>No global variables (constants are okay)</li>
<li>Procedures that perform a single task</li>
<li>IPO structure within each procedure (input first, then processing, and output only after all processing is complete)</li>
</ul>

<ol class="Assign"><li>
<p>Complete the program <code>rec2_sort.py</code> by writing the four missing functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-recursive function <code>merge</code> that merges two sorted lists.</li>
<li>The recursive function <code>mergeSort</code> takes a single unsorted list or tuple and returns a sorted list.</li>
<li>The non-recursive function <code>partition</code> that partitions (in place!) the data between
    indices <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> (the second and third arguments) using a random pivot.
    The function should return an index where the pivot ends up once the list has been partitioned.</li>
<li>A recursive function <code>quickSort</code> that uses partition to sort the portion of the data between the
specified indices. If called without specifying indices, <code>left</code> should default to \(0\) and
<code>right</code> should default to <code>len(data) - 1</code>, to sort the entire list.</li>
</ul></li></ol>
