<div class="Note">
<p>Computing Science is <b>not</b> the study of computers. Rather it is the study of the <em>process</em>
	of computation. Computers are useful <em>tools</em> that enable us to perform computations very quickly
	and accurately but they are not our primary object of study.</p>

<p>An essential concept in computing is that of an algorithm. An <b class="Red">algorithm</b> is a
	clear, unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for performing a computation. A computer program is just
	one way to describe an algorithm.</p>
</div>

<h3>Flow Charts</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Another way to describe an algorithm is to use a <b class="Red">flow chart</b>. An example of a
flow chart is shown below.</p>

<p>Every flow chart must contain a single “Start” node and a single “End” node, to identify where the
	procedure begins and ends. These nodes are drawn as ovals or ellipses. Besides the “Start” and “End”,
	flow chart nodes contain input, processing, or output instructions.</p>

<p class="Center"><img src="ct1/img/flow1.png" alt="Flow Chart"/></p>

<p><b class="Red">Input</b> means that information (data) is to be added to the algorithm. On early computers, data was
	encoded on punch cards that could be “read” by the computer. On modern computers, the easiest way to
	get input is for someone (the “user”) to type it on a keyboard. Modern computers have a number of
	wired (USB, Ethernet) and wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth) technologies that allow for the transfer of data
	to or from a computer.</p>

<p>On a flow chart, “Input” nodes are drawn as parallelograms. The text of the node should identify the
	type of data (e.g. a number, or text data) being input and should specify a name that the algorithm
	will use to refer to this data in later steps. The first node after the “Start” node in the flow chart
	above indicates that the algorithm requires numerical input, and that the input received will be referred
	to by the name <code>num</code>. We call this name a variable when the algorithm is implemented in Python
	or another high-level programming language.</p>
 
<p><b class="Red">Output</b> involves printing or displaying the results of the algorithm. In computer
	programming, output can also involve saving data to a hard disk or sending it to another computer. On a
	flow chart, output nodes (such as the nodes labelled “Print”) are also drawn as parallelograms.</p>

<p><b class="Red">Processing</b> nodes are drawn as rectangles. These nodes evaluate an expression
	(calculation) and store the result, assigning it a name for future reference.</p>
 
<p><b class="Red">Arrows</b> are used in the flow chart to show the order in which the instructions
	are to be executed. Input, output, and processing nodes have exactly one arrow pointing “in” from the
	previous instruction and one arrow pointing “out” to the next instruction.</p>

<p><b class="Red">Decision</b> nodes are drawn as rhombuses (diamonds). Each decision is a statement
	that can be either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. These nodes have a single arrow pointing
	“in” and <em>two</em> arrows pointing “out”: one for <code>True</code>  and one for <code>False</code>.
	Decisions are used for branching and looping.</p>

<p>For each decision, there must be one associated “connector”. Connectors are drawn as small circles
	that have two “in” arrows and one “out” arrow. For a loop, the connector is placed immediately before
	the decision node. For branching, the connector is placed where the <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>
	branches rejoin.</p>
</div>

<h3>Pseudocode</h3><div class="Note">
<p><b class="Red">Pseudocode</b> is a text-based description of an algorithm that is designed for
	human understanding, but is structured like a computer program. We can think of pseudocode as an
	intermediate step between a pure algorithm and an implementation in a specific programming language.</p>

<p>Because pseudocode is not an actual programming language, there are no specific rules, and different
	people are likely to write the same algorithm differently. The algorithm described by the flow chart
	above can be expressed in pseudocode as follows.</p>

<pre class="IO" data-echo="copy">
INPUT a number as <u>num</u>
WHILE <u>num</u> > 1...
  SET <u>factor</u> = 2
  WHILE <u>num</u> ÷ <u>factor</u> has a remainder...
    SET <u>factor</u> = <u>factor</u> + 1
  END-WHILE
  PRINT <u>factor</u>
  SET <u>num</u> = <u>num</u> ÷ <u>factor</u>
END-WHILE</pre>

<p>One important feature of many algorithms is yes-no or true-false decisions, which appear in the
	algorithm flow chart as branches. Pseudocode, and many programming languages, use an <code>IF</code>
	structure to identify the <code>True</code> branch and an <code>ELSE</code> structure to identify
	the <code>False</code> branch of the algorithm. A <code>WHILE-REPEAT</code> structure identifies
	decisions that the algorithm flow will “loop back” to. Indentation is helpful in grouping branches or
	blocks of pseudocode.</p>
