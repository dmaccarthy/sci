<h3>External Stylesheets</h3>
<div class="Note">
<p>So far, we have been placing all of our CSS style declarations inside a <code>style</code> element in the <code>head</code> of our HTML documents. This is
  known as an <em class="Defn">internal stylesheet</em>. This is okay when we are creating single webpages. However, many websites contain several linked pages that use
  the same style information. Internal stylesheets are inefficient because the same style information has to be included in the HTML document for each and
  every webpage. This means that the same style information is downloaded as part of every page, and if you decide to change the appearance of the website,
  you need to edit the style information in every webpage.</p>

<p>A better alternative is an <em class="Defn">external stylesheet</em>. An external stylesheet is a separate file containing CSS style information. Your
  HTML documents can then <em>link</em> to the CSS file. With the style information in a single file, webpages can be downloaded more quickly, since the style
  information only has to be downloaded once rather than with every page. Also, you only need to edit a single CSS file to change the appearance of all
  webpages that link to that file.</p>

<p>To create an external stylesheet, simply cut the CSS declarations from your <em>style</em> element (not including the tag itself!), paste them into a separate file, and save the file with a
  name ending in <code>.css</code>. Note that CSS files are <b>not</b> XML or HTML files, so you must not include the start-tag and end-tag of the <code>style</code>
  element. Once you have saved your external stylesheet, you can delete the <code>style</code> element from the <code>head</code> of your HTML document and
  replace it in the document <code>head</code> with a <code>link</code> element:</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
&lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="myStyles.css" /&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>href</code> attribute is an absolute or relative URL identifying the CSS file.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>link</code> element uses a self-closing tag. Do <b>not</b> keep the CSS declarations as a child text node
	of the <code>link</code> element. Your CSS should appear in the external stylesheet <em>only</em>.</p>
