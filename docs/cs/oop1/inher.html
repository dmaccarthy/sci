<h3>Inheritance</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Another key element of OOP (besides <em>encapsulation</em>, <em>polymorphism</em>, and <em>data abstraction</em>) is <b class="Red">inheritance</b>. We have already seen that classes are objects that act as a template for creating instances. Each class encapsulates the attributes that are common to all instances of the same data type...</p>
<p class="CaptionTitle">The <code>date</code> Class</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="oop1/img/cls_diagram.png" alt="Class Diagram"/></p>

<p>Each <b class="Red">instance</b> encapsulates its own unique attributes while <em>inheriting</em> all of the attributes of its class. As a result, instances can reference attributes encapsulated within their class as well as their own attributes...</p>
<p class="CaptionTitle">A <code>date</code> Instance</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="oop1/img/obj_diagram.png" alt="Object Diagram"/></p>

<p>For example, instances of the <code>date</code> class (from Python’s <code>datetime</code> module) can reference
    methods like <code>today</code> and data attributes like <code>max</code> that are inherited from the <code>date</code>
    class. In the Python example below, we can see that the attributes of the class are treated as attributes of any instance constructed from that class...</p>

<span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

class MyClass:
    myStr = "Hello!"
    myInt = 7

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
myInstance = MyClass()
print(MyClass.myStr, MyClass.myInt)         <span class="Comment"># Hello! 7</span>
print(myInstance.myStr, myInstance.myInt)   <span class="Comment"># Hello! 7</span>
print(myInstance.myStr is MyClass.myStr)    <span class="Comment"># True</span></pre>

<p>The last line of the program above shows that the inherited attribute is the same object (rather than a duplicate) defined in the class. This is true as long as you do not assign to the attribute using the instance name (as in the <span class="Blue">blue</span> line below). This causes Python to encapsulate the assigned object as a unique attribute of the instance. The attribute as defined in the class continues to apply to the class and to any other instances that have not had the attribute reassigned.</p>

<span class="Comment"># Example 2...</span>

class MyClass:
    myStr = "Hello!"
    myInt = 7

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
myInstance = MyClass()
<span class="Blue">myInstance.myStr = "Goodbye!"</span>
print(MyClass.myStr, MyClass.myInt)         <span class="Comment"># Hello! 7</span>
print(myInstance.myStr, myInstance.myInt)   <span class="Comment"># Goodbye! 7</span>
print(myInstance.myStr is MyClass.myStr)    <span class="Comment"># False</span></pre>

</div>

<h3>Shared Attributes</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Inheritance allows us to define attributes that are <em>shared</em> between the class and all of its instances. Shared
    attributes are also called <b class="Red">static attributes</b> or <b class="Red">class attributes</b>. The example
    below defines an <code>int</code> attribute that keeps track of how many instances of the class have been created...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 3...</span>

class MyClass:
    count = 0

    def __init__(self):
        MyClass.count = MyClass.count + 1

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
inst1 = MyClass()
inst2 = MyClass()
print(inst1.count)       <span class="Comment"># 2</span>
print(inst2.count)       <span class="Comment"># 2</span>
print(MyClass.count)     <span class="Comment"># 2</span></pre>

<p>Note that when the shared attribute is modified, we must refer to it using the class name (i.e. <code>MyClass.count</code>) rather than an instance name (i.e. <code>self.count</code>) for the attribute to remain shared.</p>
<p>If we assign an attribute using an instance name, the new attribute becomes unique to that instance and is no longer shared with the class and other instances...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 4...</span>

class MyClass:
    count = 0

    def __init__(self):
        self.count = self.count + 1

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
inst1 = MyClass()
inst2 = MyClass()
print(inst1.count)       <span class="Comment"># 1</span>
print(inst2.count)       <span class="Comment"># 1</span>
print(MyClass.count)     <span class="Comment"># 0</span></pre>
</div>

<h3>Static & Class Methods</h3><div class="Note">
<p>As we have seen, by default Python will automatically pass the instance as the first argument (to the parameter <code>self</code>)
    for any method called using an instance. For some methods, such as a modifier for a shared data attribute, we may
    want Python to always pass the <em>class object</em> rather than the instance. To do this, add the <b class="Red">decorator</b>
    <code>@classmethod</code> on the line before the method definition. The first parameter of a class method is conventionally
    named <code>cls</code> rather than <code>self</code>...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 5...</span>

class MyClass:
    count = 0

    <span class="Blue">@classmethod</span>
    def advanceCounter(<span class="Blue">cls</span>):
        <span class="Blue">cls</span>.count = <span class="Blue">cls</span>.count + 1

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
inst1 = MyClass()
inst2 = MyClass()
print(inst1.count)      <span class="Comment"># 0</span>
inst2.advanceCounter()
print(inst1.count)      <span class="Comment"># 1</span></pre>
<p>In some situations, we may want to define a method that does not access or modify any of the attributes of the class
    or of any instances of the class. In such a case, we do not need to pass an instance (<code>self</code>) or a class
    (<code>cls</code>) as the first parameter. To do this, define the method using the <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 6...</span>

from random import randint

class Dice:

    <span class="Blue">@staticmethod</span>
    def roll (dice=1):
        while dice > 0:
            yield randint(1,6)
            dice = dice - 1

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
for roll in Dice.roll(4):
    print("You rolled a {}!".format(roll))</pre>
</div>

<h3>Subclasses</h3><div class="Note">
<p>We saw above that instances inherit the attributes of the class from which the instance is created. Inheritance can
    also be applied from one class to another. For example, suppose we had defined a class <code>Rectangle</code> with
    methods to calculate a rectangle’s area and perimeter. If we then wanted to define a class <code>Square</code>, we
    would not need to start from scratch; since a square is a special kind of rectangle, the methods we created for
    rectangles can be used for squares too!</p>
<p>In the Python program below, the first line of the <code>Square</code> class definition references the <code>Rectangle</code>
    class in parentheses. This means that we are defining <code>Square</code> to be a <b class="Red">subclass</b>
    (sometimes called a <b class="Red">derived class</b>) of <code>Rectangle</code>. <code>Rectangle</code> is called the
    <b class="Red">superclass</b> (or <b class="Red">base class</b>) of <code>Square</code>.</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 7...</span>

class Rectangle:

    def __init__(self, b, h):
        self.base = b
        self.height = h

    def area(self):
        return self.base * self.height

    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.base + self.height)


class Square (Rectangle):

    def __init__(self, s):
        self.base = s
        self.height = s


sq = Square(3.0)
print(sq.area(), sq.perimeter())</pre>

<p>Subclasses inherit the attributes of their superclass. This means that the <code>area</code> and <code>perimeter</code> methods
    defined in the <code>Rectangle</code> class will automatically become attributes of the <code>Square</code> class too.
    The <code>__init__</code> method will <u>not</u> be inherited since the definition of this method in <code>Square</code>
    will <em>override</em> <code>Rectangle</code>’s version of this method. Instances of a subclass are considered to be
    instances of the superclass as well: any <code>Square</code> instance is also a <code>Rectangle</code> instance.</p>
<p>Python includes a function <code>isinstance</code> that checks whether an object is an instance of a particular class...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 8...</span>

print(type(sq))                   <span class="Comment"># &lt;class '__main__.Square'&gt;</span>
print(isinstance(sq, Square))     <span class="Comment"># True</span>
print(isinstance(sq, Rectangle))  <span class="Comment"># True</span>
print(isinstance(sq, int))        <span class="Comment"># False</span></pre>
</div>

<h3>Multiple Inheritance</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Some object-oriented programming languages, including Python, support multiple inheritance. This means that a derived
    class can inherit attributes from more than one base class. In the example below, the class <code>MyClass</code> is
    derived from the classes <code>MyXClass</code> and <code>MyYClass</code>. The derived class inherits an attribute <code>x</code>
    from <code>MyXClass</code> and an attribute <code>y</code> from <code>MyYClass</code>. It also defines a third
    attribute <code>z</code>...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 9...</span>

class MyXClass:
    x = 0

class MyYClass:
    y = 1

class MyClass (MyXClass, MyYClass):
    z = 2


<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.x, obj.y, obj.z)</pre>
<p>When the base classes contain attributes with the same name, the derived class will inherit the attribute from the
    base class which is listed first. In the example below, both base classes (<code>MyXClass</code> and <code>MyYClass</code>)
    include an attribute <code>w</code>. Since <code>MyXClass</code> is listed first in the definition of <code>MyClass</code>,
    <code>MyXClass.w</code> will be inherited and <code>MyYClass.w</code> will not...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 10...</span>

class MyXClass:
    x = 0
    w = 3

class MyYClass:
    y = 1
    w = 4

class MyClass (MyXClass, MyYClass):
    z = 2

<span class="Comment"># Main program...</span>
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.w)</pre>
<p>In general, Python looks up instance attributes in the following order...</p>
<ol>
    <li>Is the attribute stored in the instance itself?</li>
    <li>Is the attribute stored in the instance’s class?</li>
    <li>Is the attribute stored in a base class of the instance’s class?  (Base classes are searched in the order in which they are listed in the class definition.)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>All programs require the use of good programming techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal documentation (docstrings and comments)</li>
<li>Descriptive variable names</li>
<li>No global variables (constants are okay)</li>
<li>Methods that perform a single task</li>
<li>IPO structure within each method (input first, then processing, and output only after all processing is complete)</li>
</ul>


<ol class="Assign">
<li>Duplicate your <code>oop3_temp3.py</code> program from the previous assignment as <code>oop4_temp.py</code>. Modify
    your <code>Temperature</code> class to include static methods named <code>freezing</code>, <code>boiling</code>, and <code>absZero</code>
    that return <code>Temperature</code> instances representing water’s freezing and boiling points (0 °C and 100 °C) and
    absolute zero (0 K). Also include a class method that keeps track of how many <code>Temperature</code> instances
    were created using each of the three temperature units. Write a new main program to test these new features of your
    <code>Temperature</code> class.</li>
<li>You have been hired to design and code an object-oriented Python 3 program for a local restaurant. The program
    should define a class <code>MenuItem</code> that contains information about each item on the menu such as the item
    name, price, whether it is taxable, and the number of items ordered. There should also be a class <code>Menu</code>
    that contains the list of menu items, and methods for modifying the menu, placing orders, and creating reports
    (e.g. sales of each menu item, number of customers, etc.), and resetting the daily totals at the start of each
    business day. The program requires a user-friendly interface. Save the program as <code>oop4_menu.py</code>.</li>
