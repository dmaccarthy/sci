<p>In previous lessons, we have used the terms “class” and “data type” interchangeably. Strictly speaking, in Python a <b class="Red">class</b>
    is an object that <em>defines</em> a data type by <em>encapsulating</em> the data attributes and methods associated with that data
    type. Other object-oriented language (such as C++ and Java) may define classes differently, and some object-oriented
    languages (such as Javascript versions before 2015) do not use classes at all.</p>
<p>Suppose we wanted to create a Python data type to represent temperature measurements. One of the things we would want
    <code>Temperature</code> objects to do is to convert between units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). From an object-oriented perspective,
    we might describe the <code>Temperature</code> data type using the following class diagram...</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="oop1/img/cls_temp.png" alt="Temperature"/></p>

<p>According to the class diagram above, <code>Temperature</code> instances would require a single data attribute, a
    <code>float</code> value describing the temperature being represented. We have named this attribute <code>degC</code>,
    implying that we plan to use the Celsius temperature scale to represent <code>Temperature</code> objects; however, we
    could just as well have used Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.</p>
<p>All classes require a <b class="Red">constructor</b> function that can be called to create instances of the classes. As we
    have seen, Python constructors have the same name as the class itself.</p>
<p>We need three methods to allow us to specify the value of the temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees. These
    are the methods in the class diagram whose names start with ‘set’. Each of these methods has a single <code>float</code>
    parameter which represents the value to which the temperature is being set.</p>
<p>Methods whose primary purpose is to set or change the value of one or more of an object’s data attributes are called
    <b class="Red">modifier</b> methods (or <b class="Red">setters</b>).</p>
<p>The final three methods in the class diagram are used to retrieve the temperature data on the desired temperature scale.
    These methods require no arguments and return the temperature as a <code>float</code> value. Methods whose primary
    purpose is to retrieve data from an object are called <b class="Red">accessor</b> methods (or <b class="Red">getters</b>).</p>

<h3>Python Classes</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Below is a Python program that uses the <code>Temperature</code> class described by the class diagram above to convert a
    temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees. Note that the <code>Temperature</code> class is not part of the Python
    standard library and that the program below will not work until we have written a definition for this class...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 1...</span>

<span class="Blue">temp = Temperature()</span>        <span class="Comment"># Create a Temperature instance</span>
temp.setCelsius(20.0)       <span class="Comment"># Set the temperature to 20.0 °C</span>
print(temp.Fahrenheit())    <span class="Comment"># Print the temperature in Fahrenheit</span></pre>

<p>To make the program run without errors, we will need to define a class <code>Temperature</code> that has methods
    <code>setCelsius</code> and <code>Fahrenheit</code>. The class definition must be placed <em>before</em> the main program,
    because Python cannot create a <code>Temperature</code> instance before the class has been defined.
    Also notice that the two method definitions below are <em>indented</em> to show that they are part of the class definition...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 1 (continued)...</span>

class Temperature:
    <span class="Comment">"A class for representing temperature data"</span>

    def setCelsius (self, degC=0.0):
        <span class="Comment">"Set the temperature value in °C"</span>
        self.degC = degC

    def Fahrenheit (self):
        <span class="Comment">"Return the temperature value in °F"</span>
        return self.degC * 1.8 + 32.0</pre>

<p>The first line of the main program above (shown in <span class="Blue">blue</span>) uses the <code>Temperature</code>
    constructor to create a <code>Temperature</code> instance. In Python, the interpreter creates a constructor automatically
    for every class we define. Therefore, we don’t need to do anything to define the constructor.</p>
<p>The first parameter of the <code>setCelsius</code> and <code>Fahrenheit</code> methods is named <code>self</code>. When
    a method is called, Python automatically passes the instance as the first parameter. It is a strong convention in Python to always use the parameter name
    <code>self</code> for this argument. In short, the methods will use the name <code>self</code> to refer to the
    <code>Temperature</code> instance that the main program calls <code>temp</code>.</p>
<p>It may take a little getting used to, but the method definitions appear to have one extra parameter when compared to the
    number of arguments being passed by the main program. This is because the first parameter (<code>self</code>) is included
    in the method definition but is omitted when the method is called.</p>
<p>Each method above comprises a single instruction. The <code>setCelsius</code> method simply records the temperature
    argument as a data attribute (<code>self.degC</code>) of the <code>Temperature</code> instance. The <code>Fahrenheit</code>
    method converts this value to Fahrenheit degrees using the appropriate formula and returns the result.</p>
<p>Run the example to make sure it works properly. Try changing the value of the temperature from 20.0 °C to something else to
    be sure the program is doing what is intended to do!</p>
<p>Here are the additional methods that appear in the class diagram but are not actually needed by our simple example program.
    Note that since we have used Celsius degrees for our internal representation of the temperature, the modifier and accessor
    for Celsius units simply record or return the data without performing any unit conversions. The Fahrenheit and Kelvin
    modifiers convert the temperature to Celsius before recording it and the accessors convert the temperature back from
    Celsius before returning it.</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment"># Example 1 (continued)...</span>

    def setKelvin (self, degK=0.0):
        <span class="Comment">"Set the temperature value in Kelvins"</span>
        self.degC = degK - 273.15

    def setFahrenheit (self, degF=0.0):
        <span class="Comment">"Set the temperature value in °F"</span>
        self.degC = (degF - 32.0) / 1.8

    def Celsius (self):
        <span class="Comment">"Return the temperature value in °C"</span>
        return self.degC

    def Kelvin (self):
        <span class="Comment">"Return the temperature value in Kelvins"</span>
        return self.degC + 273.15</pre>
<p>Try using the <code>setKelvin</code> or <code>setFahrenheit</code> methods to set the temperature instead of
    <code>setCelsius</code>. Also try printing the temperature in Celsius or Kelvin. Does the program still work properly?</p>
</div>

<h3>Data Abstraction</h3><div class="Note">
<p>We have already discussed one of the key features of the OOP paradigm: <em>encapsulation</em>. A second important aspect of
    OOP is <b class="Red">data abstraction</b>. Data abstraction aims to “hide” the details of how data is represented as much
    as possible, so that the programmer can focus more on what we want to do with the object and less on how the object works.</p>
<p>Suppose a computer program to operate a nuclear reactor was written using the procedural programming paradigm rather than
    OOP. The program might use a floating point value to represent the temperature of the reactor core. Suppose a subprogram
    responsible for measuring the core temperature used Celsius degrees but the subprogram responsible for monitoring the
    temperature thought the temperature was in Fahrenheit. As you can imagine, the consequences could be disastrous! Each part
    of the program would need to know how the temperature data was represented, and every subprogram would need to use the same
    representation when exchanging data with any other subprogram. If the program was written originally using Fahrenheit and
    we decided to change to Celsius, we would need to re-write every subprogram that depended on how the temperature was represented.</p>
<p>Contrast this with an OOP approach using the <code>Temperature</code> class from this lesson as an example. If one
    subprogram in our nuclear reactor program wanted to use <code>Fahrenheit</code> degrees, it could “communicate” with the
    <code>Temperature</code> instance using the <code>setFahrenheit</code> and <code>Fahrenheit</code> methods, while another
    subprogram could be using <code>setCelsius</code> and <code>Celsius</code>. It would not matter to either subprogram
    whether the object’s data was actually stored as Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin degrees. If we decided to change the data
    representation (say from Fahrenheit to Celsius), we would only need to re-write the <code>Temperature</code> class definition;
    subprograms that interact with <code>Temperature</code> instances would not need to be revised at all since they do not
    depend on how the temperature data is represented.</p>
<p>The interaction between an object and parts of the program that use the object is similar to that of a server and a client
    communicating over the Internet. When a client (e.g. a web browser) sends a request for information over the Internet, it
    trusts that the server (e.g. salcomp.ca, YouTube, GMail, etc.) will respond with the requested data. The client has no way
    of knowing whether the server loads a prepared web page from a file, runs a program to generate the web page on-the-fly,
    or sends the request to an underpaid intern who types out the response on a keyboard. The client does not need to know how
    the server actually works.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can think of an object as a server and the object’s methods as requests that the server can process.
    Attributes that are intended to act as requests must not depend on how the object is implemented. Such attributes are
    considered to be <b cvlass="Red">public</b>. For example, we can call the <code>Temperature</code> class’s
    <code>setCelsius</code> method regardless of which temperature units the object actually uses to store the data.</p>
<p>Attributes of an object that depend on how the object is implemented (e.g. how the data is represented) are called
    <b class="Red">private</b> attributes. Private attributes should never be referenced outside of the class definition.
    For example, the data attribute <code>degC</code> of the <code>Temperature</code> class must be considered private,
    since it only exists when the temperature is represented using Celsius degrees.</p>
</div>

<h3>Access Control</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Some OOP languages (e.g. Java) allow (or require!) you to specify whether each attribute of a class is private or public.
    Declaring an attribute as private ensures that the attribute cannot be referenced outside of the class definition.
    Public attributes can be referenced from anywhere in the program.</p>
<p>Some languages include an intermediate level of access control called <em>protected</em>. Protected attributes can be
    referenced from anywhere within the <em>module</em> where the class is defined but cannot be accessed from other modules.</p>
<p>Python does <u>not</u> provide a formal access control mechanism; as far as the interpreter is concerned, all attributes are public. This is in keeping with Python’s multi-paradigm nature and its philosophy of programmer flexibility.</p>
<p>However, when using Python to write programs using the OOP paradigm, you should always treat attributes that depend on the
    object’s implementation as private! The convention in Python is to give private attributes names that begin with an
    underscore character. In our <code>Temperature</code> class definition, we should rename the
    <code>degC</code> attribute as <code>_degC</code> to comply with this convention. Attributes that begin with an underscore
    should never be referenced outside of the class definition.</p>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>All programs require the use of good programming techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal documentation (docstrings and comments)</li>
<li>Descriptive variable names</li>
<li>No global variables (constants are okay)</li>
<li>Methods that perform a single task</li>
<li>IPO structure within each method (input first, then processing, and output only after all processing is complete)</li>
</ul>

    <p>The object diagram below illustrates a class designed to represent a point in a 2D plane.</p>
    <p class="Center"><img src="oop1/img/cls_point2d.png" alt="Point2D"/></p>
    <p>Recall from Math class that points can be represented as an ordered pair containing the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates.
        The methods <code>setCoords</code> and <code>coords</code> are the simple modifier and accessor for this class. The
        remaining methods calculate the distance, slope, and midpoint between the <code>Point2D</code> instance (<code>self</code>)
        and a second point (<code>other</code>). Here are the relevant Math equations, where the subscript 1 refers to
        <code>self</code> and 2 refers to <code>other</code>...</p>
    <p>
        $$\mathrm{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
        $$\mathrm{Slope} = {y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1}$$
        $$\mathrm{Midpoint} = ({x_1 + x_2 \over 2}, {y_1 + y_2 \over 2})$$
    </p>
    <p>Complete the program <code>oop2_point2d.py</code> by writing a definition for the <code>Point2D</code> class that behaves
        as described. A <code>main</code> function is included to test that your class works correctly. Once your program
        produces the correct output, change the coordinates of the two points to verify that the output remains correct.</p>
