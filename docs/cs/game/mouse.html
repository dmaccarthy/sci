<p>You can “bind” mouse events to your sketch, or to sprites and other objects within your sketch, using
    the <code>onclick</code>, <code>ondrag</code>, <code>onmouseover</code>, <code>onmouseout</code>,
    <code>onmouseup</code>, and <code>onmousemotion</code> keywords. These handlers take two arguments:
    a reference to the graphics object affected, and a description of the event. Mouse events have a
    <code>pos</code> attribute that describes the mouse coordinates of the event and a <code>rel</code>
    attribute that describes the difference between the current coordinates and the coordinates of the
    last event. They also have a <code>button</code> or <code>buttons</code> attribute that tells which
    button(s) was pressed during the event.</p>

<p>In this example, there are two different event handler functions for <code>onclick</code>: one that runs
    when we click on the <em>sprite</em>, and one when we click anywhere else in the <em>sketch</em>.
    Since we cannot use the same function name twice, we have used <code>onclick</code> for the sprite’s
    event handler and we have called the sketch’s event handler <code>missed</code>. The sketch can’t tell
    from the function name that the function is supposed to run when the mouse is clicked, so we have to
    explicitly identify missed as the <em>onclick</em> event handler when we call the <code>bind</code>
    method (shown above in red).</p>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>Create your own video game using the <code>game.py</code> program. Your game can be original or a
    recreation of a classic game but your code must be 100% your own. It must be graphics-based (as
    opposed to a console game) and the player must be able to interact using mouse and/or keyboard events.
    Your program must follow good programming practices, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Internal documentation (docstrings and comments)</li>
    <li>Descriptive variable names</li>
    <li>No global variables (constants are okay)</li>
    <li>Procedures that perform a single task</li>
    <li>IPO structure within each procedure (input first, then processing, and output only after all processing is complete)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <code>media</code> folder for any images and/or audio files required by your program.</p>
<p>After completing the program, you must also make a <em>User’s Manual</em> to explain the goal of the
    game and how to use it. Save a copy of this <a target="GDoc" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QG7S6bSxuvmEO79HSuHO2w66VpvQqZjkbfbo2zuw2jI">Google
    Doc</a>. There is a “Credits” section for you to record the source of any images or audio that you did
    not create yourself.</p>
<p>After you have completed the game and <em>User’s Manual</em>, you will be given a self-assessment to complete.</p>
