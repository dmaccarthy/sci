<p>We saw in an <a href="#s8custom">earlier lesson</a> that you can use an <code>ondraw</code> function
    to customize your <code>sc8pr</code> animations while they are running. Your sketch’s <code>ondraw</code>
    function is an example of an <b class="Red">event handler</b>: a function that gets called in response
    to an event that occurs in your program. In this case, the event is that <code>sc8pr</code> has finished
    drawing a frame of your animation. This is only one of many possible events. You can visit the
    <code>sc8pr</code> documentation for a <a target="sc8" href="https://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr/?evList">complete list</a> of events.</p>
<p>When creating games or other interactive graphics programs, you may want to use event handlers to make your
    program respond to mouse and keyboard events. In the example below, we give the sketch an event handler
    called <code>onkeydown</code> which will be called every time a key is pressed. This event handler has
    two arguments, the sketch itself, and a description of the event. The event description has a property
    <code>ev.unicode</code> which is a string that tells us the letter pressed. In this example, when the
    <code>"a"</code> is pressed, the sprite is moved 5 pixels left (by changing its <code>pos</code> attribute)
    and when the <code>"s"</code> is pressed it is moved 5 pixels right.</p>

<span class="Comment">"Example 1 - Keyboard Events"</span>

def onkeydown(sk, ev):
    <span class="Comment">"Move the alien with the keyboard"</span>
    player = sk["player"]
    x, y = player.pos
    letter = ev.unicode.lower()
    if letter == "a":
        player.pos = x - 5, y
    elif letter == "s":
        player.pos = x + 5, y</pre>

<p>A computer keyboard has several special keys, such as the arrows and the Shift key, that are not represented
    by a string. For these keys, the <code>ev.unicode</code> value will be an empty string. To use these keys,
    you can use the <code>ev.key</code> property which gives a numerical code describing the key. Here is the
    same event handler as above, but using the left and right arrow keys to move the alien instead of the
    <code>"a"</code> and <code>"s"</code>. You can import the key codes (such as <code>K_LEFT</code>) from
    <code>pygame.constants</code>.</p>

def onkeydown(sk, ev):
    <span class="Comment">"Move the alien with the keyboard"</span>
    player = sk["player"]
    x, y = player.pos
    key = ev.key
    if key == K_LEFT:
        player.pos = x - 5, y
    elif key == K_RIGHT:
        player.pos = x + 5, y</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>Use <code>sc8pr</code> to create a simple, graphics-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game, <code>v04_rps1.py</code>.
    (You might have already written a console-based version of this game in an earlier course!)
    <p class="Center"><img src="game/img/rps1.png" alt="Image"/></p>
    <p>The user should type one of the three letters: R, P, or S. The program should display the player’s choice on the left and the computer’s (random) choice on the right. It should also display “Winner” below the winning choice, or “Tie” in the middle. The player can play as many rounds of the game as she or he wants.</p>
</li>
<li>Duplicate your Rock-Paper-Scissors game as <code>v04_rps2.py</code> and modify it to display the score in the upper corners...
