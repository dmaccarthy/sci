<h3>Animation</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Once your <code>setup</code> function has finished, <code>sc8pr</code> runs the animation for you. It does this by drawing the
    first “frame” of the animation, waiting about 1/60<sup>th</sup> of a second, and then drawing the next frame. It continues to draw
    additional frames at a rate of about 60 per second (if the computer is fast enough to maintain this speed) until you close the
    program window.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>setup</code> function (which initializes your sketch), you can create an <code>ondraw</code> function
    to make changes to your sketch. The <code>sc8pr</code> system will run your <code>ondraw</code> function at the end of each
    animation frame. Here is an example...</p>

<span class="Comment">"Example 1 - Customizing with ‘ondraw’"</span>

from random import uniform, randint
from sc8pr import Sketch, Image, BOTH
from sc8pr.sprite import Sprite

def setup(sk):
    <span class="Comment">"Initialize the sketch"</span>
    sk.bg = Image("img/sky.png")
    sk.alien = Image("img/alien.png")

    if randint(0, sk.frameRate) == 0:
        h = sk.height / 10
        s = uniform(-2, 2)
        v = uniform(-2, 2), uniform(-2, 2)
        sk += Sprite(sk.alien).config(spin=s, height=h,
            vel=v, pos=sk.center, bounce=BOTH)

Sketch().play()</pre>

<p>The <code>ondraw</code> function in this example uses Python’s <code>randint</code> function to decide whether or not to create a new alien sprite. It chooses a random number between 0 and 60 (the sketch frame rate) and it only creates a new sprite if this random number is 0. This will result in one new sprite every second on average. The sprite’s velocity and spin are set randomly using the <code>uniform</code> function.</p>
<p>In order for the <code>ondraw</code> function to work, you must <b class="Red">bind</b> the function to your sketch by passing the
    function to the sketch’s <code>bind</code> method (as shown above in <span class="Blue">blue</span>). If you don’t do this, <code>sc8pr</code> won’t know that it is supposed to run the <code>ondraw</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>ondraw</code> function requires two arguments: the first (<code>sk</code>) is a reference to the sketch and the second (<code>ev</code>) describes the event.</p>
</div>

<h3>Pre-Loading Images</h3><div class="Note">

<p>The code below creates a sprite from an image file...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">Sprite("img/alien.png")</pre>
<p>Loading and decoding an image from a file is one of the <em>slowest</em> operations the animation will perform. If we were to
    reload and decode the image file every time we created a sprite, the program would likely run very slowly.</p>
<p>If you need to reuse an image many times, it is usually best to load and decode the image <em>once</em> before you need it (i.e. in the <code>setup</code> function) and keep the decoded image in the computer’s memory for when it is needed. In Example 1 above, the following line in the <code>setup</code> loads the alien image...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">sk.alien = Image("img/alien.png")</pre>
<p>The decoded image is stored in the computer’s RAM and can be accessed using the variable name <code>sk.alien</code>. Prefixing the
    variable name with <code>sk.</code> stores the data along with the sketch object’s data. This prevents the data from being deleted at the end of the <code>setup</code> function, as would happen if we used a local variable.</p>
<p>When the <code>ondraw</code> function needs the image data to make a sprite, it runs the following...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">sk += Sprite(sk.alien)</pre>
<p>This creates the sprite from the already-decoded image data represented by <code>sk.alien</code>.</p>
<!-- <p>Another change we have made to this program is that we have loaded the <code>img/alien.png</code> image in the <code>setup</code> function, and assigned it the variable name <code>sk.alien</code>.  When we create new sprites in the <code>ondraw</code> function, we use this already-loaded image to create the sprites rather than reloading the image file. Loading and decoding image files is one of the slowest aspects of an animation, so it is best to pre-load any images your program will require.</p> -->
</div>

<h3>Collisions</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Besides creating new sprites, your <code>ondraw</code> function might also remove sprites. For example, you might want to detect whether or not any of the sprites are colliding with each other and remove any that are.
    To do this, replace the <code>ondraw</code> function from the example above with the following and add <code>Collisions</code> to your imports...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment">"Example 2 - Collisions"</span>

def ondraw(sk, ev):
    <span class="Comment"># Remove colliding sprites</span>
    remove = <span class="Blue">Collisions(sk).among()</span>
    if remove:
        sk -= remove
        print("Removed {} sprites!".format(len(remove)))

    <span class="Comment"># Randomly create alien sprites</span>
    if randint(0, sk.frameRate) == 0:
        h = sk.height / 10
        s = uniform(-2, 2)
        v = uniform(-2, 2), uniform(-2, 2)
        sk += Sprite(sk.alien).config(spin=s, height=h,
            vel=v, pos=sk.center, bounce=BOTH)</pre>

The <code>Collisions</code> function creates a collision-detector for your sketch. The <code>among</code> method obtains a list of colliding sprites which we assign to the variable <code>remove</code>.
    These sprites are then removed from the sketch using the <code>-=</code> operator. Here is the <a target="sc8" href="https://dmaccarthy.github.io/sc8pr/?collisions">documentation</a> for <code>sc8pr</code>’s collision detector.
</div>

<h3>Mouse Position</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Another thing you might want to do each frame is to adjust one or more sprites’ properties. For example, we can make the sprites chase the mouse pointer by changing their velocity so that the sprite is always moving toward the mouse. We could add the following lines between the removal of the colliding sprites and the creation of new random sprites...</p>
<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="copy">
<span class="Comment">"Example 3 - Follow the Mouse"</span>

for alien in sk.sprites():
    v = delta(sk.mouse.pos, alien.pos, 2)
    alien.config(vel=v)</pre>

<p>In this example, we calculate the velocity toward the mouse’s current position (<code>sk.mouse.pos</code>) from the alien’s
    current position (<code>alien.pos</code>) at a speed of 2 pixels per second. (The <code>delta</code> function can be imported
    from <code>sc8pr.geom</code>.) We then set this as the alien’s velocity property. We use a <code>for</code> loop so that this
    update is applied to <em>all</em> of the alien sprites.</p>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ol class="Assign">
<li>Revise the program <code>v02_mouse.py</code> so that the sprites are all created with a velocity toward the mouse. Do <u>not</u> change the existing aliens’ velocities when the mouse is moved.</li>
<li>Duplicate the program from the previous question as <code>v02_aliens.py</code> and modify it so that:
    <ul>
    <li>The player can use the mouse to move <u>one</u> of the sprites.  Use a different image, such as a spaceship or a different species of alien, for the player’s sprite as for the aliens. In order to distinguish this one sprite from all the others, you will need to assign it a name.  When creating the sprite do this...
    <pre class="Code">sk["player"] = Sprite(image)</pre>
    instead of this...
    <pre class="Code">sk += Sprite(image)</pre>
    You can use the expression <code>sk["player"]</code> to refer to the player’s sprite.</li>
    <li>Additional sprites (aliens) are created at random times with random sizes and velocities.</li>
    <li>Aliens are removed whenever they collide with the player’s sprite but not with each other. To accomplish this, instead of calling <code>Collisions(sk).among()</code> which detects all colliding sprites, use the following line to detect which sprites are colliding with the player’s sprite:
    <pre class="Code">remove = Collisions(sk).involving(sk["player"])</pre></li>
    <li>The player gets one point for each sprite removed. Print the score in the console whenever it changes.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
