<h3>String Literals</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python string literals are enclosed in quotes. Either the single quote or the double
	quote character may be used; however, you cannot use one type of quote to start the
	string literal and the other quote character to end the string.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex1.py'</span>

print("Hi there!")
print('Greetings!')
print("This is bad.')    <span class="Comment"># Syntax Error!</span></pre>

<p>As we have already seen with docstrings, Python also allows you to create “long”
	string literals that are identified by three consecutive single or double quote
	characters to start and end the string. String literals expressed this way may extend
	over multiple lines.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex2.py'</span>

print("""This string
   takes up
  three lines.""")</pre>
</div>

<h3>Escape Characters</h3><div class="Note">
<p>The backslash character is used to create <b class="Red">escape sequences</b>: characters that for one
	reason or another cannot be typed directly in a string literal. For example, if you use
	single quotes to start and end the string literal, you cannot include the single quote
	character (which also serves as the apostrophe) within the string data.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex3.py'</span>

print('That's mine!')   <span class="Comment"># Syntax Error!</span></pre>

<p>Normally, you would use double quotes to enclose a string that contains a single quote
	character, and single quotes to enclose a string that contains double quotes.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex4.py'</span>

print("That's mine!")
print('"Sabre Pride"')</pre>

<p>Things become difficult when a string contains both single and double quote characters.
	In cases like this, the character that would otherwise confuse the interpreter must be
	“escaped”.</p>

<p>In the example below, the backslash character indicates that the single quote immediately
	following it is part of the string data and does not mark the end of the string literal.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex5.py'</span>

print('She said, "That\'s mine!"')</pre>

<p>Other common escape sequences are <code>\n</code> which represents a “new line” (also called line
	feed or LF) character and <code>\t</code> which represents a tab character. These are
	demonstrated in the first line below.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex6.py'</span>

print('Line 1\nLine 2\n\tLine 3')
print('\u00A9 2023')
print('C:\\Python38\\python.exe')</pre>

<p>You can use escape sequences to include Unicode characters in string data even when
	the character cannot be typed from your keyboard. Unicode escape sequences consist of
	<code>\u</code> followed by a four digit hexadecimal code, or <code>\U</code> followed
	by an eight digit hexadecimal code. For example, <code>\u00A9</code> is the escape
	sequence for the © character as shown in the second line above.</p>

<p>Python 3 does allow you to type (or paste) Unicode characters directly into your
	program.  If your editor allows you to, you can use the © symbol without escaping it.
	Just be sure that your source file is saved using UTF-8 encoding if it contains
	non-ASCII characters.</p>

<p>String data that contains a backslash character (as in the final line of the example
	above) should always be escaped.</p>
</div>

<h3>Operators</h3><div class="Note">
<p>The <code>+</code> operator can be used to join two or more strings to make a new, larger string.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex7.py'</span>

str1 = 'Hello, '
str2 = 'world!'
str3 = str1 + str2
print(str3)          <span class="Comment"># Hello, world!</span></pre>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator can be used to repeat a string several times.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex8.py'</span>

print(3 * 'Hi!')     <span class="Comment"># Hi!Hi!Hi!</pre>

<p>The <code>in</code> operator can be used to check if a string contains a specific
	letter or sequence of letters.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex9.py'</span>

print('a' in 'Hi!')   <span class="Comment"># False</span></pre>

<p>Python has a <code>len</code> (length) function that will return the number
	of characters in a string.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex10.py'</span>

print(len("Hi there!"))   <span class="Comment"># 9</span></pre>
</div>

<h3>Indices &amp; Slices</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python provides a mechanism for slicing strings into smaller strings. Each character in
	a string has its own index.  An index is an integer that describes how far the
	character is located from the beginning of the string.  The first character in any
	string always has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, etc.</p>

<p>Python also allows negative indices that describe a character’s location compared to
	the end of the string; e.g. the last character in the string has an index of −1, etc.
	To select a single character from a string, the string expression is followed by square
	brackets enclosing the index to be selected.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex11.py'</span>

sal = "Salisbury Composite High School"
print(sal[0])        <span class="Comment"># S</span>
print(sal[1])        <span class="Comment"># a</span>
print(sal[10])       <span class="Comment"># C</span>
print(sal[-1])       <span class="Comment"># l</span>
print(sal[-8])       <span class="Comment"># h</span></pre>

<p>To select several consecutive characters from a string, we use the same notation with
	the starting and ending indices separated by a colon. Note that the starting index is
	included in the result but the ending index is not. For example, <code>sal[10:14]</code>
	creates a string from the characters with indices 10 through 13 with the index 14 not
	included.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex12.py'</span>

sal = "Salisbury Composite High School"
print(sal[10:14])    <span class="Comment"># Comp</span></pre>

<p>If you include the colon but omit the starting index, Python assumes you want to
	start from the beginning of the string. If you include the colon but omit the ending
	index, Python assumes you want to go to the end of the string.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex13.py'</span>

sal = "Salisbury Composite High School"
print(sal[:3])       <span class="Comment"># Sal</span>
print(sal[20:])      <span class="Comment"># High School</span>
print(sal[-6:])      <span class="Comment"># School</span></pre>

</div>

<h3>String Methods</h3><div class="Note">
<p>A method is a function that is defined as part of a class definition. One of the
	methods defined for the <code>str</code> class is called <code>find</code>: it is used
	to find the index of the first occurrence of a character or sequence of characters
	within a string. The <code>str.find</code> method uses object-oriented syntax just like
	the <code>str.format</code> method we used for formatting output. Rather than passing
	the string as an argument, type the string or its variable followed by <code>.find</code>.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex14.py'</span>

sal = "Salisbury Composite High School"
index = sal.find("is")
print(index)                 <span class="Comment"># 3</span></pre>

<p>Some additional string methods that you may find useful are.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>upper</code>: Convert a string to all uppercase letters.</li>
	<li><code>lower</code>: Convert a string to all lowercase letters.</li>
	<li><code>replace</code>: Replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring.</li>
	<li><code>strip</code>: Remove whitespace (spaces, tabs, line feeds, etc.) from the beginning and end of the string.</li>
	<li><code>format</code>: Inserts numbers and other objects into a string and controls how they are formatted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's17_ex15.py'</span>

sal = "Salisbury Composite High School"
print(sal.upper())
print(sal.lower())
print(sal.replace("o", "q"))</pre>

<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#str"
	target="Py3">Python documentation</a> for more information on string methods.</p>
