<h3><code>for</code> Loop</h3><div class="Note">
<p>We saw that Python’s <code>while</code> statement is used to run a block of instructions repeatedly
	as long as the Boolean condition we provide remains <code>True</code>. We also saw that flags and
	counters are useful techniques for stating the Boolean condition.</p>

<p>Another type of loop available in Python is a <code>for</code> loop. For-loops are used to
	<b class="Red">iterate</b> through a <b class="Red">sequence</b>. One type of sequence is a string; Python
	treats each string value as a sequence of individual characters.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's14_ex1.py'</span>

word = "Salisbury Composite High School"
for letter in word:
    print(letter)</pre>

<p>Run the program above. You will see that it prints each of the letters on its own line.
	The loop works by assigning the variable name <code>letter</code> to the first value in the sequence,
	in this case the letter <code>S</code>. The indented block is then executed on this value. Once the
	block is complete, <code>letter</code> is assigned the next value in the sequence, <code>a</code>, and the indented
	block is repeated. This loop continues until each of the values in the sequence has had
	its turn as <code>letter</code>.</p>

<p>Python allows “nested” loops and conditionals. This means that you can have an <code>if</code>
	statement within a <code>for</code> loop, for example. The program below will print each of the
	lower case letters and punctutation marks on its own line, but will ignore any upper case letters.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's14_ex2.py'</span>

word = "Salisbury Composite High School"
for letter in word:
    if letter == letter.lower():
        print(letter)</pre>

<p>Each level of nesting requires an additional level of indentation; the <code>if</code> statement
	is indented to show it is part of the <code>for</code> loop, and the <code>print</code> statement
	is indented again to show it is part of the <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p>Besides strings, other types of sequences that you can iterate through include files	and lists of numbers or other data.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's14_ex3.py'</span>

data = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
for num in data:
    print(num)</pre>

</div>

<h3><code>range</code> Function</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python has a built-in <code>range</code> function that can be used to produce sequences of integers.
	For example, calling <code>range(10)</code> produces the sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. This gives
	you an alternate way to loop with a counter. The following example runs the loop ten times, with the
	variable <code>count</code> keeping track of how many times the loop has run.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's14_ex4.py'</span>

for count in range(10):
    print(count)</pre>

<p>This is more concise than using a <code>while</code> loop with a counter, because you do not need
	to initialize or increment the <code>count</code> variable.</p>

<p>You can pass more arguments to the <code>range</code> function to create other sequences of
    numbers. For example, if you want to count by twos, starting at 10 and ending at (but not
    including!) 20...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's14_ex5.py'</span>

for count in range(10, 20, 2):
    print(count)</pre>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>The Fibonacci Sequence example from the last lesson (<code>s13_ex2.py</code>) has been duplicated as 
    <code>s14_fib.py</code>. Modify the program so that it uses a <code>for</code> loop with the
    <code>range</code> function, instead of a <code>while</code> loop. Let the user enter the number of
    terms to print.</li>

<li>Suppose you are writing a guessing game program like “Hangman”. Your program needs to be able to
    display only the letters that have already been guessed, as well as spaces and punctuation marks.
    Letters that have not yet been guessed would be shown as a blank or placeholder character such as
    a star.
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># A portion of program 's14_hangman.py'</span>

answer = "STAR WARS"
guesses = "AESD"</pre>

Complete the program using a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through the letters in <code>answer</code>
so that it produces the following output. The program must continue to work properly even if you change
the <code>answer</code> and <code>guesses</code>.
<pre class="IO">S
*
A
*

*
A
*
S</pre></li>

<li>One important application of iteration is to <b class="Red">search</b> through a set of data
    to see if any of it matches the criteria we are looking for. For example, we might be looking for
    a particular student in the school’s database or for students who did not get a passing mark. Modify
    the program <code>s14_fail.py</code> so that only prints out the student numbers and marks of students who earned marks
    below 50.</li>

<li>Duplicate your previous program (<code>s14_fail.py</code>) into the file <code>s14_highest.py</code>. Modify the
    program so that it searches and prints out the student who earned the highest mark in the class.</li>
</ol>
