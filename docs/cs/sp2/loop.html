<h3><code>while</code> Loops</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Often when we are writing a program to solve a problem, we need to run the same instructions
	repeatedly. Here is a program that keeps printing random numbers until it gets a number greater
	than 99.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's12_ex1.py'</span>

from random import uniform

num = uniform(0, 100)       <span class="Comment"># Get the first number</span>
<span class="Blue">while num <= 99:</span>            <span class="Comment"># LOOP...</span>
    print(num)              <span class="Comment">#   Print the number</span>
    num = uniform(0, 100)   <span class="Comment">#   Get a new number</span>
print(num)                  <span class="Comment"># Print the last number</span></pre>

<p>The <code>while</code> statement (shown above in blue) tells Python to repeat all of the indented
	instructions as long as a certain condition remains <code>True</code>.  The <code>while</code>
	statement and the indented block that immediately follows it is called a <b class="Red">loop</b>.</p>

<p>In this example, the loop is controlled by a Boolean expression, <code>num &lt;= 99</code>. This
	“condition” will remain <code>True</code> as long as the <code>uniform</code> function returns a number
	that does not exceed 99. The program will keep printing random numbers until the <code>uniform</code>
	function eventually returns a number that is greater than 99. This makes the loop condition
	<code>False</code> and the loop will end. The program will print this last number and then exit.</p>

<p>In Python, <b class="Red">indentation</b> is used to structure loops just as it is for <code>if-elif-else</code> blocks. Only the two indented statements in the example are repeated. The final statement in the program is unindented to show that it is not part of the loop. It will only run once, after the loop is finished.</p>
<p>Python allows you to have <b class="Red">nested</b> indented blocks, for example an <code>if</code> statement inside a <code>while </code> loop:</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's12_ex2.py'</span>

from random import randint

roll = None
while roll != 7:
    die1 = randint(1, 6)
    die2 = randint(1, 6)
    roll = die1 + die2
    if roll == 2:
        print("Snake eyes!")
    elif roll == 12:
        print("Boxcars!")
    else:
        print("You rolled a {}.".format(roll))</pre>
</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>For this and all future assignments, do not create “Spaghetti code” by using the <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statements, or the <code>exit</code> function!</p>
<ol class="Assign">
<li>The program <code>s12_choice.py</code> presents the player with four choices and asks them to
    select one by typing a number between 1 and 4. If the user types a number outside of this range,
    the program needs to ask again, until it receives valid input. Modify the program so that it rejects
    any number that is not between 1 and 4 and asks the user to try again until valid data is received.
    (Do not worry about dealing with input that cannot be converted to an integer at all.)</li>
<li>Write a Python program <code>s12_grade.py</code> to ask the user to enter their grade. Use
    a <code>while</code> loop so that if the user enters a number that is not between 10 and 12, the
    program will reject the grade and ask again.</li>
</ol>
