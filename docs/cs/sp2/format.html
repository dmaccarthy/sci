<h3>Templates &amp; Format Specifiers</h3><div class="Note">
<p>When writing a program, it is good to keep the user in mind. How will your program look to the
	people using it? Will they be able to understand how to use your program? As the programmer,
	you have a much greater knowledge of the program than your users.</p>

<p>One thing you can do to make your program more user-friendly is to make it visually appealing
	and organized. Python provides a function called <code>format</code> that gives you more control
	over how data is converted to text to be displayed in the console.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's15_ex1.py'</span>

from math import sqrt

num = float(input("What is your favourite number? "))
root = sqrt(num)
print("The square root of", num, "is", root, ".")</pre>

<p>The output of the program might look like this:</p>
<pre class="IO">What is your favourite number? <span class="Blue">6</span>
The square root of 6.0 is 2.449489742783178 .</pre>

<p>To make this output cleaner, we might want to round the answer to a smaller number of decimal places,
    and to remove the unnecessary space before the period. To do this, we create a <b class="Red">template</b>
    string that shows what we want the output to like like, using curly brackets <code>{}</code> as
    placeholders to show where the data will be inserted.</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code">template = "The square root of {} is {}."</span></pre>

<p>You can use any variable name you want; you don’t have to call it <code>template</code>.</p>
<p>We can type an optional <b class="Red">format specifier</b> inside the braces. In the example below, <code>.2f</code> is a format code that tells
    Python we want to insert data as a floating point number with two decimal places. Python requires a colon
    immediately before the format specifier.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's15_ex2.py'</span>

from math import sqrt

num = float(input("What is your favourite number? "))
root = sqrt(num)
<span class="Blue">template = "The square root of {:.2f} is {:.2f}."</span>
print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>(num, root))</pre>

<p>After creating your template, call its <code>format</code> function to insert the data into the
    template with the desired format. The example above produces the following output.</p>

<pre class="IO">What is your favourite number? <span class="Blue">6</span>
The square root of 6.00 is 2.45.</pre>
</div>

<h3>Tables</h3><div class="Note">
<p>When a program displays data in a table, such as sports league standings, we want to make sure the
    columns line up properly. We can do this with a template and the <code>format</code> function as well.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's15_ex3.py'</span>

standings = [
    ("Pandas", 18, 2),
    ("Gryphons", 16, 4),
    ("Bears", 15, 5),
    ("Tigers", 11, 9),
    ("Lions", 7, 13),
    ("Sharks", 6, 14),
    ("Dinos", 3, 17)
]

<span class="Comment"># Print column headings</span>
<span class="Blue">template = "{:^10s} {:>5s} {:>5s}"</span>
print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>("TEAM", "Won", "Lost"))

<span class="Comment"># Print the data</span>
<span class="Blue">template = "{:^10s} {:5d} {:5d}"</span>
for team, won, lost in standings:
    print(<span class="Blue">template.format</span>(team, won, lost))
</pre>

<p>This will produce the following output.</p>
<pre class="IO">   TEAM      Won  Lost
  Pandas      18     2
 Gryphons     16     4
  Bears       15     5
  Tigers      11     9
  Lions        7    13
  Sharks       6    14
  Dinos        3    17</pre>

<p>The format specifier <code>^10s</code> tells Python to display a string in a column ten
    characters wide. The caret (<code>^</code>) tells Python to centre the data within the column.
    We could change this to a less-than sign or greater-than sign to align along the left or right
    side of the column.</p>
<p>The format specifier <code>5d</code> tells Python to display an integer in decimal (not binary)
    format in a column that is five characters wide. We can specify a column width for floating point
    numbers too; <code>8.2f</code> means a floating point number with two decimal places in a column
    eight characters wide.</p>

	href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#str.format">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Formatted String Literals</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Starting with version 3.6 of Python, there is a new feature called <b class="Red">formatted string literals</b> or f-strings.
    This is basically an abbreviated syntax for formatting strings. The example below does the same as <code>s15_ex2.py</code> above,
    but uses an f-string (shown in <span class="Blue">blue</span>) rather than an explicit call to the <code>format</code> method.
    Note the <code>f</code> before the opening quotation mark of the f-string!</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's15_ex4.py'</span>

from math import sqrt

num = float(input("What is your favourite number? "))
root = sqrt(num)
print(<span class="Blue">f"The square root of {num:.2f} is {root:.2f}."</span>)</pre>

<p>The f-string is evaluated immediately when it is created.
    If you want to evaluate a formatted string repeatedly with different data,
    you should still create a template and call the <code>format</code> method
    for each data record, as you learned in the previous sections of this lesson.</p>
<p>F-strings also allow you to include an <em>expression</em> rather than just a single variable name...</p>
<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's15_ex4.py' (continued)</span>

<span class="Comment"># This also works!</span>
print(f"The square root of {num:.2f} is {<span class="Blue">sqrt(num)</span>:.2f}.")</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3><ol class="Assign">
<li>The program <code>s15_circle.py</code> calculates the circumference and area for circles of various sizes, and prints
    the results in a table. Modify the program so that numbers are displayed to three decimal places
    and are arranged in columns of fixed width, with the numbers aligned at the decimal point.</li>

<li>The program <code>s15_cities.py</code> prints the largest Canadian cities by metro population based on the 2021 census.
    Modify the program to display the data in fixed-width columns with the numbers aligned at the last digit.</li>
