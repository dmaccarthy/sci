<h3>Numerical Accumulators</h3><div class="Note">
<p>One common use of iteration (loops) is for <b class="Red">accumulation</b>. This
	involves performing some sort of total over a set of data. The example below shows iteration
    over a set of student marks. The program performs three totals:</p>
<ul>
<li>total number of students in the class (<code><span class="Blue">student</span></code>)</li>
<li>total number of students who earned an “A” (<code><span class="Red">grade_A</span></code>)</li>
<li>total of all the individual student marks (<code><span class="Green">total_marks</span></code>)</li>
</ul>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's16_ex1.py'</span>

from resource import marks_list

<span class="Comment"># Initialize accumulators</span>
<span class="Blue">student = 0</span>
<span class="Red">grade_A = 0</span>
<span class="Green">total_marks = 0</span>

<span class="Comment"># Iterate</span>
template = "Student {} earned a mark of {}."
for mark in marks_list:
    <span class="Blue">student += 1</span>         <span class="Comment"># Count students</span>
    <span class="Red">if mark >= 80:</span>       <span class="Comment"># Count students with an 'A'</span>
        <span class="Red">grade_A += 1</span>
    <span class="Green">total_marks += mark</span>  <span class="Comment"># Total marks</span>
    print(template.format(student, mark))

<span class="Comment"># Output totals</span>
print("\nStudents =", student)
print("Total =", total_marks)
print("Average =", total_marks / student)
print("Students with an A =", grade_A)</pre>

<p>Each total is performed using an <b class="Red">accumulator</b> variable, which have been colour-coded in the example above.
    Before the loop begins, each accumulator is initialized to a value of <code>0</code>. As we iterate
    through the data, examining each student’s mark one at a time, we count the number of students in the
    class by adding <code>1</code> to the <code><span class="Blue">student</span></code> variable
    each pass through the loop.</p>
<p>We do the same for the <code><span class="Red">grade_A</span></code> accumulator, but only when
    the mark is 80 or higher. This allows us to count how many students earned an “A”. Finally, we
    use the <code><span class="Green">total_marks</span></code> accumulator to keep a running total
    of all the students’ marks.</p>
<p>When the loop finishes, the three accumulators contain the three totals we set out to calculate.</p>
	
</div>

<h3>String Accumulators</h3><div class="Note">
<p>We can also use accumulation with strings. Suppose you had a secret message and wanted to encrypt
    it. You could initialize the accumulator variable (<code><span class="Blue">cypher</span></code>)
    to an empty string, <code>""</code>. As you iterate through the original message, one letter at
    a time, you would add the encrypted letter to the cypher string.</p>

<pre data-echo="copy" class="Code"><span class="Comment"># Program 's16_ex2.py'</span>

<span class="Comment"># Input</span>
plain = "This is a secret message!"

<span class="Comment"># Processing</span>
<span class="Blue">cypher = ""</span>
for letter in plain:
    <span class="Blue">cypher += chr(ord(letter) + 3)</span>

<span class="Comment"># Output</span>
print(cypher)</pre>

<p>The program above encrypts the message by shifting each letter by three places based on its Unicode value;
    <code>'a'</code> gets converted to <code>'d'</code>, and <code>'T'</code> gets converted to <code>'W'</code>.
    (The built-in Python functions <code>ord</code> and <code>chr</code> convert characters to Unicode
    values and back.)</p>

</div>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>Although Python does include some functions that perform accumulation and searching,
    such as <code>sum</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>min</code>, do not use these
    functions in completing the assignment. You must implement the accumulation/search
    loop yourself! Use accumulator variables and implement your solutions using a
    <em>single</em> iteration loop.</p>
<ol class="Assign">
<li>The example program <code>s16_ex1.py</code> has been copied as <code>s16_grades1.py</code>. Modify the program so that it also
accumulates and prints the number of students with grades of B (65-79), C (50-64) and F (0-49). Note that you do not need an accumulator for the F’s;
you can just subtract the A’s, B’s, and C’s from the total number of students in the class.</li>

<li>Copy <code>s16_grades1.py</code> as <code>s16_grades2.py</code> and modify it further to
    determine the highest and lowest marks in the class.</li>

<li>Copy your program <code>s14_hangman.py</code> as <code>s16_hangman.py</code>. Modify the
    program to use a string accumulator to collect the answer and print it on a single line rather
    than one letter at a time. The partially-guessed answer (<code><span class="Black">STAR
    WARS</span></code>) should display as:
<pre class="IO">S*A* *A*S</pre></li>
</ol>
