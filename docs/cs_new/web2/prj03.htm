<p>There is a big basketball game in the school gym tonight and the scoreboard has broken down. You’ve been hired to design a new
scoreboard as an HTML 5 document that can be projected onto a screen in the gym. The scoreboard must display:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the period/quarter,</li>
    <li>the time remaining in the period/quarter,</li>
    <li>the home team name,</li>
    <li>the home team logo,</li>
    <li>the home team score,</li>
    <li>the home team fouls/penalties,</li>
    <li>the visiting team name,</li>
    <li>the visiting team logo,</li>
    <li>the visiting team score,</li>
    <li>the visiting team fouls/penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, you just have to design the appearance of the scoreboard; you don’t have to make it functional yet.</p>
<p>All data that might change as the game progresses must be in its own tag with a unique id attribute:</p>
<pre class="Code" data-echo="html">&lt;span id = "HomeScore" onclick = "changeHomeScore()"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>Timekeeper controls for starting and stopping the clock and recording goals and penalties should have an event handler attribute (e.g. <code>onclick</code>), although you do <b>not</b> need to write the event handler Javascript function.</p>
<p>As a bonus, add a popup <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that has a child <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> node for playing highlights and replays.</p>

<p>Ensure that the page displays correctly in both small and large browser windows and that it passes without errors in an <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html" target="Val">HTML5 validator</a>.</p>

<p>Create the scoreboard in files <code>prj03.html</code> and <code>prj03.css</code> in your <code>web2</code> OneDrive folder.
    Use CSS to make the appearance attractive. Keep all style definitions in the external CSS file.</p>
