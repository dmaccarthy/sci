<h2 class="Collapse">Formatting Tags</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>Sometimes you may want to emphasize some of the words in your text with bold type or italics. HTML provides tags to accomplish this.
	The code below produces a paragraph of text all in the default style.</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p&gt;My favourite movie is Raiders of the Lost Ark.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Suppose you want the word "favourite" to be in bold type and the movie title to be in italics.
	To do this, you would change your code to:</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p&gt;My <span class="Blue">&lt;b&gt;</span>favourite<span class="Blue">&lt;/b&gt;</span> movie is <span class="Blue">&lt;i&gt;</span>Raiders of the Lost Ark<span class="Blue">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> (bold) and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italics) tags split the paragraph text
	into several different nodes. The text with <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> as its parent element (i.e.
	the word "favourite") will be displayed in bold while the text with <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> as
	its parent ("Raiders of the Lost Ark") will be italicized. The rest of the text, which
	has the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag as its parent, will be displayed using the default style
	for paragraphs.</p>

<p>HTML also has an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (emphasis) tag. By default, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag
	italicizes text, the same as the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag. However, as we will learn in a
	future lesson, the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag can be customized to emphasize the text in any
	way you want. You can make text bold and italicized and underlined and a different
	colour if you want to.</p>

</div></section>

<section class="Post" data-icon="html5">
<h2 class="Collapse">Anchors &amp; Hyperlinks</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>Another useful HTML tag is the anchor tag, abbreviated as the letter <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
	An anchor is a portion of your document that links to another document on the web.
	You can mark off text as an anchor exactly as you mark off text to be bold or
	italicized.</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p&gt;Please visit the <span class="Blue">&lt;a&gt;</span>Sal Comp website<span class="Blue">&lt;/a&gt;</span>.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>To make the anchor actually work, you need to specify the web address (uniform
	resource locator or URL) of the document being linked. You do this by giving the
	anchor element an <code>href</code> (short for hypertext reference) attribute.</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p&gt;Please visit the &lt;a <span class="Blue">href="https://www.salcomp.ca"</span>&gt;Sal Comp website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>There are two ways to specify a URL. The example above is an <em class="Defn">absolute
	URL</em>; it begins with <code>https://</code> or another protocol that your browser
	supports. This method is usually used to link to documents located on a different
	server than the document that contains the anchor.</p>

<p>When linking to a document located on the same server (e.g. a different page within
	the same website), a <em class="Defn">relative URL</em> is usually used instead.
	Relative URLs do not include <code>https://</code> or any other web protocol. Instead,
	the web browser assumes that the URL is relative to the folder containing the current page.</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>href...</th><th>Means</th></tr>
	<tr><td>someFile.html</td><td>A document in the same folder as the current document.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>someFolder/someFile.html</td><td>A document in a subfolder of the one containing the current document.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>../someFile.html</td><td>A document in the parent folder of the one containing the current document.</td></tr>
</table><p></p>

<section class="Post" data-icon="html5">
<h2 class="Collapse">Titles</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>All of the tags we have introduced so far for the body of the HTML document (except
	for the line break tag) support a <code>title</code> attribute. This attribute is
	used to display additional information when the mouse is positioned over the text.</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p <span class="Blue">title="Good job!"&gt;</span>Place your mouse here.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>Sometimes, you may want to attach a title to a specific word or words (not the whole
	paragraph) without changing the style of the words to bold or italics. There is a tag
	called <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> that can be used to mark off text without changing its
	appearance:</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;p&gt;I go to <span class="Blue">&lt;span title="Great School!"&gt;</span>Sal Comp<span class="Blue">&lt;/span&gt;</span>.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<h2 class="Collapse">Assignment</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<ol class="Assign">
<li>In the document <code>w07_whatsOn.html</code>, create a webpage that highlights
    three of your favourite TV shows. Your webpage should include the information from
    the <a href="https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings" target="TV">TV listings</a> as well
    as your own (appropriate) comments on the shows. Include links to the TV listings,
    the TV channels’ website, and the three shows’ official websites. Be sure to
    demonstrate your ability to create bold and italics and to use titles.</li>
