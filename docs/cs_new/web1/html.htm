<h2 class="Collapse">XML Applications</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>The XML format is used to store data for many common applications, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Office Documents: Many Office programs such as Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, etc.), LibreOffice
		and OpenOffice use XML to save document information and content.</li>
	<li>Scalable Vector Graphics: Most graphics formats (jpeg, png, bmp) store images as an array of
		pixels. When the image is resized it creates distortion. SVG uses XML to describe the image
		geometrically instead of as individual pixels. SVG images can be resized without loss of image
		quality.</li>
	<li>MathML & SMIL: These are XML applications for describing mathematics and multimedia content
		respectively.</li>
	<li>GeoGebra: This is a geometry and algebra program that stores data using XML. This application can
		be used to embed dynamic drawings in webpages.</li>

<h2 class="Collapse">Hypertext Markup Language</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>The World Wide Web was created in the early 1990’s with the development of the
	<em class="Defn">Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML is a markup language that describes documents
	(webpages) available for viewing over the Internet. HTML was based on (but not completely compatible
	with) an earlier markup language known as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) which was
	formalized in 1986.</p>

<p>XML is actually a subset of SGML. The first XML specification was published in 1998.  XML and HTML
	are similar as a result of their shared SGML ancestry. Once the XML specification was released, work
	began on revising HTML to make it fully compatible with XML. The result, in 2000, was the eXtensible
	Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML): a language for encoding web pages using XML.</p>

<p>More recently, the newer HTML5 language was created. HTML5 is similar to, but not completely
	compatible with XML. Below is an HTML5 document that describes a blank webpage.</p>

<!-- <p>To preview the page, click your mouse in the code area while holding the Alt key and paste the data into your browser’s address bar.
    Use the Shift key instead if you want to paste the HTML code into an IDE or <a target="edit"
    href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_html_editor.php">online editor</a>.
</p> -->

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-CA"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;<span class="Blue">Blank</span>&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>The root element node in an HTML5 document uses the tag <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> in lower case. It
	often contains a <code>lang</code> attribute to specify the language in which the document is written.
	The <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declaration is also <code>html</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element has two child elements, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. The
	<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element has a child element <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> which contains the document title
	as a text node.</p>

<p>The content of the document will be placed in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> can
	contain other data such as style information to alter the layout and appearance of the document.</p>

<section class="Post" data-icon="html5.svg">
<h2 class="Collapse"><code>meta</code> Tags</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>HTML documents may contain one or more <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of
	the document...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;<span class="Blue">Example</span>&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag is used to include information about your webpage that can be used by
	browsers, search engines, and other programs that read the document. In the example above, the
	<code>charset</code> meta tag identifies the encoding, so that the browser can decode the bytes that
	make up the HTML file into characters. When creating HTML documents, make sure that you save your
	files using the same encoding that you have declared in your meta tag.</p>

<!-- <p>The <code>X-UA-Compatible</code> meta tag is used to tell the Internet Explorer web browser which compatibility
	mode to use so that the webpage will be rendered properly. Other browsers will ignore this tag.</p> -->

<section class="Post" data-icon="html5.svg">
<h2 class="Collapse">Paragraphs</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>The simplest kind of content that you can include in your webpage is text. In HTML, text is added
	using a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, which is short for paragraph. Paragraph elements are included as
	child nodes of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element, and the text content is a child text node of the
	<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. As you can see in the example below, XML comments are supported in HTML...</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
<span class="Black">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-CA"&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;<span class="Blue">Poem</span>&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</span>
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<span class="Comment">&lt;!-- Verse 1 --&gt;</span>
        <span class="Blue">Mary had a little lamb,
        little lamb, little lamb,
        Mary had a little lamb,
        whose fleece was white as snow.</span>
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;<span class="Comment">&lt;!-- Verse 2 --&gt;</span>
        <span class="Blue">And everywhere that Mary went,
        Mary went, Mary went,
        and everywhere that Mary went,
        the lamb was sure to go.</span>
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
<span class="Black">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>When you preview the HTML in your browser, it does not display the data tree like it would for an
	XML file. The web browser recognizes the file as HTML and displays the content as a webpage. If you
	want to see the HTML markup, activate the browser's “developer tools” (usually by pressing F12), and
	going to the “Elements” or “Inspector” tab.</p>
<p>The blue text is the content that will be displayed by the browser with the tags organizing the information for the browser.</p>

<p>For our poem webpage, something appears to be wrong! The lines of each verse run together as a
	single line! This is because web browsers ignore whitespace in HTML. Whitespace means space
	characters, tab characters, or end-of-line characters. Web browsers treat all whitespace as if it
	were just a single space. As a result, even though our HTML document has each verse of the poem
	written as four lines, the poem is rendered with each verse as a single line.</p>

<p>One option is to make each line into its own paragraph. If we did this, the browser would add space
	between every line. The other option is to use line break (<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>) tags as shown below.</p>

<p>Note that we have only shown the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> portion of the document. The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    elements shown in black in the previous example must also be included.</p>

<h2 class="Collapse">Headings</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>HTML provides six levels of heading tags (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>..<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) that
	work just like the paragraph tag, except that they are used for titles, subtitles, and section
	headings rather than regular text. Text in a heading tag is displayed more emphatically that text in
	a normal paragraph; <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the most emphatic, while <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the least emphatic
	heading.</p>

<p>The examples below only show the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. A proper HTML document would also include the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
