<h2 class="Collapse">Numbered &amp; Bulleted Lists</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>Instead of regular paragraphs, HTML documents can display text in ordered (numbered) or
	unordered (bulleted) lists. The tags used to create list elements are <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
	and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Each item within the list is represented by a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list
	item) tag. The list items must be child nodes of the list element. The following code
	inside the document body creates one bulleted list and one numbered list. </p>

<pre class="Code" contenteditable="true" data-echo="html">
&lt;ul&gt;<span class="Comment">&lt;!-- Unordered (Bulleted) List --&gt;</span>
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the first item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the second item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the third item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;<span class="Comment">&lt;!-- Ordered (Numbered) List --&gt;</span>
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the first item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the second item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;<span class="Blue">This is the third item.</span>&lt;/li&gt;

<ol class="Assign">
<li>
    <p>You have been hired to design a website for a local Italian restaurant, <i>A Taste of Tuscany</i>.
        The website consists of a home page and a daily specials page, each of which links to the other.
        The manager has provided you with printed designs for each page.</p>
    <p class="Center"><img src="./cs_new/web1/img/tuscany.png" alt="Taste of Tuscany"/></p>
    <p>Create an HTML5 document <code>w10_Tuscany.html</code> for the home page, complying with
        the manager’s specifications. Also complete <code>w10_specials.html</code> for the page
        describing the daily specials.</p>
    <p>You will need to design or find an illustration for each page that is suitable for an
        Italian restaurant. Since the restaurant does not want to be sued for copyright violation,
        if you use an illustration from the web you must ensure that it is a public domain image
        or that it is licensed for commercial use (for example, a Creative Commons licence is
        acceptable unless the licence specifies “NC”, non-commercial.) You must also link to
        the page from where you obtained the image; clicking the image should open the webpage
        where you obtained the image from.</p>
    <p>The appearance of your page should be as close as possible to the manager’s design
        with regard to italics, bold, text size, etc. (You have not yet learned how to centre
        text or illustrations, so do not worry about that!)</p>
