    <p>Create a file <code>prj02.html</code> in your <code>CompSci/web1</code> OneDrive folder. Use this file to create an HTML 5 document that has the same content and appearance as this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZxpKwLGVgpkp5eE-HpyDqw9Evi8GpNq/view?usp=drive_link" target="pdf">PDF document</a>. When viewed in the browser, your document should not only look the same but the hyperlinks should lead to the same sources.</p>
    <p>To extract the image, download the document and open it with Adobe Reader or Acrobat; right-click the image and choose “Save Image As...”. Be sure to choose a web-compatible format such as PNG or JPG.</p>
    <p>If your version of Adobe Reader / Acrobat does not have a “Save Image As...” action, copy the image to the clipboard and paste it as new image in Microsoft Paint or similar paint program to save it.</p>
    <p>Once you have saved the image, locate the PNG / JPG file in Windows File Explorer and cut and paste it into your <code>CompSci/web1</code> folder.</p>
