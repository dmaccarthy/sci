<p>We have already studied sequential versus direct file access. Sequential access involves reading the file from the beginning; this can be inefficient for large files. Direct access involves jumping to the location where the data we want to read or modify is located. This is more efficient than sequential access, but it works best when all records are the same size.</p>
<p>One technique that programmers can use to improve access to large data files is to create an <b class="Red">index</b>. An index is a secondary data file that contains pointers or links to records in the primary data file.</p>
<p>Consider this small portion of a database of Alberta municipalities. Each record contains the municipality name, type, population, latitude, and longitude...</p>
<pre class="IO">Airdrie;City;45711;N51-17-30;W114-00-52
Banff;Town;7584;N51-10-41;W115-34-19
Calgary;City;1120225;N51-03;W114-04
Camrose;City;17286;N53-01-22;W112-49-42
Edmonton;City;817498;N53-32;W113-30
...</pre>

<p>An index for this file might contain the following data...</p>
<pre class="IO">0,40,77,113,153,189...</pre>
<p>These numbers are pointers that tell us the location to seek in the file when we want to access a particular record. For example, the record representing Airdrie starts at byte 0 while Banff begins at byte 40. If we store the index in binary form, we would not even need to read the entire index. To locate the 100th record, we could read bytes 396 through 399 of the index (assuming each pointer used 4 bytes) and these bytes would tell us where to seek in the primary data file.</p>
<p>We can sequence the pointers in the index file alphabetically by municipality name, even if the records are not alphabetical in the primary data file! To locate a municipality (e.g. Wetaskiwin) in the primary data file by sequential access, we could end up reading almost the entire file. Using an alphabetical index, we could pick a record from the middle of the data and by reading that one record, determine whether the target record comes before or after. This would eliminate half the records in the file by just one single comparison!</p>
<p>We can create multiple indexes for each primary data file. For example, we might have one index sequenced alphabetically and a second index ordered by the population of each municipality.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The file <code>resources/ab.txt</code> is a text file containing the sample data for five Alberta municipalities given in the notes above. Write a Python 3 program <code>f06_makeIndex.py</code> that reads the file and creates a binary index file named <code>resources/ab.indx</code> of 4-byte unsigned pointers.</li>
    <li>The program <code>f06_browse.py</code> uses the primary data file and the index file from question 1. The program allows the user to type a record number and responds by outputting the corresponding data.The user can type -1 to quit the program. Complete the program by implementing the functions <code>readIndex</code> and <code>getRecord</code>.</li>
    <li>Duplicate your program from question 2 as <code>f06_Alberta.py</code>. Modify the program so that the user can add, delete, and edit records. Note 1: You must update the index every time you make changes to the data file. Note 2: To delete a record, you only need to remove its pointer from the index; you do not actually have to remove the data from the primary file.</li>
