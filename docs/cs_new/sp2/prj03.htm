    <p>Create a file <code>prj03.py</code> in your <code>CS10</code> repl.
        Use this file to write a Python program that asks the user to enter a positive number. Your program should then check that
        the user’s number meets the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it must be greater than zero,</li>
        <li>it must be an even number,</li>
        <li>it must <b>not</b> be a multiple of 5,</li>
        <li>the next number must not be a “perfect square*”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>[*A perfect square is a number whose square root is a whole number, for example 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25.]</p>
    <p>Your program must tell the user if their number is acceptable, and if not it must state all of the failed criteria.
    Here are three sample runs of the program, with the user input in blue and the program output in black...</p>
<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">Please give me a number: <span class="Blue">15</span>
I'm sorry...
...that number is NOT even!
...that number IS a multiple of 5!
...the next number (16) IS a perfect square!

<span class="Red">*** RESTARTING ***</span>

Please give me a number: <span class="Blue">8</span>
I'm sorry...
...the next number (9) IS a perfect square!

<span class="Red">*** RESTARTING ***</span>

Please give me a number: <span class="Blue">16</span>
That's a good number!</pre>
