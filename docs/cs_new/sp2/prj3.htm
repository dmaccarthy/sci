<p>Complete both of the programming tasks below. Use VS Code to create, edit, and test your programs. Create the program files in the <code>cs10/python</code> folder of your Computing Science OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>All programs should have a docstring and relevant comments, and should use the “IPO” (Input, Processing, Output) program structure. Use descriptive names for variables.</p>
<p>Use only programming techniques that have been covered in these lessons. Examples that you find on the web often use
techniques that are considered bad programmming practice that should be avoided.</p>

<h2 class="Collapse">Let’s Make a Deal</h2><div class="Collapse">
<p>The game show <em>Let’s Make a Deal</em> debuted on TV in 1963. One part of the game required contestants to choose one of three doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. Behind one of the doors was a prize. The other two doors contained nothing (or a “zonk” prize).</p>
<p>After the contestant selected a door, the show host revealed one of the two other doors, showing that it contained no prize. The door containing the real prize would <em>never</em> be the one revealed.</p>
<p>The contestant could then choose to keep their original selection, or switch to the remaining door that had not been revealed.</p>
<p>Download this program as <code>p3_deal.py</code>.</p>

    <li>Randomly select the door where the prize is located.</li>
    <li>Randomly select the contestant’s choice.</li>
    <li>Randomly decide whether the contestant will hold (keep their original door) or switch to the other non-revealed door.</li>
    <li>Print the results to the console as in the examples below, if playing less than 100 rounds.</li>

<h2 class="Collapse">Package Factory</h2><div class="Collapse">
<p>The Package Factory manufactures three types of packages identified as <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>. The masses of these packages are 27.5, 14.6 and 81.3 grams respectively.</p>

<p>Employees in the shipping department need to calculate the total mass of each order. You need to write a Python program that does this. Each order will be represented by a string indicating the number of each package ordered. For example...</p>

<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">12A 7B</pre>

<p>The above string represents an order of twelve package <code>A</code>’s, seven package <code>B</code>’s and no package <code>C</code>’s. The packages do not need to be in order. Sometimes, two or more orders may be combined so that the package type might be repeated...</p>

<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">2B 4A 3C 10A 7B</pre>

<p>The above would result in fourteen <code>A</code>’s, nine <code>B</code>’s, and three <code>C</code>’s.</p>

<p>Download this program as <code>p3_package.py</code>. Modify the program so that it asks the user to enter the order as described above, and then calculates the total number of each package and the total mass of the order.</p>

<pre data-echo="p3_package.py" data-title="1" class="Code"><span class="DocString">"Package Factory shipping calculator"</span>

<span class="Comment"># Package masses...</span>
A = 27.5
B = 14.6
C = 81.3

<p>Here is a sample of the program output with the user input printed in blue...</p>

<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">Enter an order: <span class="Blue">2B 4A 3C 1A 7B</span>
  5 A's have a mass of 137.5 grams.
  9 B's have a mass of 131.4 grams.
  3 C's have a mass of 243.9 grams.
Total order is 512.8 grams!</pre>

<h2 class="Collapse">Fizz Buzz</h2><div class="Collapse">

<p>Create a Python program in the file <code>p3_fizz.py</code>. The program must ask the user to enter a positive integer and then should print all the numbers from 1 to whatever number the user entered. A number that is an exact multiple of 3 is called a “Fizz” while a number that is a multiple of 5 is a “Buzz”. If it is a multiple of <em>both</em> 3 and 5, it’s a “FizzBuzz”. As your program prints the numbers, it prints “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” beside these numbers.</p>
<p>Format the output so that the last digits of the numbers are aligned, up to five digit numbers.</p>

<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">Please enter a positive integer: <span class="Blue">16</span>

<p>The letter the user types must be at the centre of the square. That letter must be surrounded by a square of the <em>preceeding</em> letter, which is in turn surrounded by a square of its <em>preceeding</em> letter, and so on. The outer square will always be made of <code>A</code>’s.</p>
