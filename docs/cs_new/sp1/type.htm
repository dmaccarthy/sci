<p>We saw in the last assignment that the program below did not produce the expected output!</p>

<pre data-echo="s06_number.py" data-title="1" class="Code">num = input("What is your favourite number? ")
print(2 * num)
print(2 + num)</pre>

<p>If you type <code>5</code> when prompted for your favourite number, you might expect
	the program to print <code>10</code> (2 * 5) and <code>7</code> (2 + 5) as its output.
	What the program actually does is print <code>55</code>, and then crash when it tries
	to run the last instruction. The reason this happens is that Python encodes text data
	differently than it encodes numerical data. Python is not smart enough to realize that
	we are asking the user to input a number, so it encodes whatever the user types as
	text. When your program multiplies text by a number, it repeats the text the specified
	number of times...</p>

<pre data-echo="s07_ex1.py" data-title="1" class="Code">print(2 * "Hi")   <span class="Comment"># HiHi</span>
print(2 * 5)      <span class="Comment"># 10</span>
print(2 * "5")    <span class="Comment"># 55</span></pre>

<p>Python crashes when you try to add text to a number because it doesn’t know how to do
	this! When Python keeps track of your program’s data, it also tracks the <em>type</em>
	of data. It does this using something called a <em class="Defn">class</em>. Text data
	is encoded as a sequence or “string” of individual characters. The Python class for
	text data is called <code>str</code>.</p>

<p>There are two different types of encoding for
	numbers. Numbers that have a decimal part are encoded using something called “floating
	point” and the Python class for this type of number is <code>float</code>.  Numbers
	without a decimal part use the class <code>int</code> (integer).</p>
</div>

<h3>Converting Types</h3><div class="Note">
<p>Python classes can be used like a function to convert data from one type to another,
	as shown in blue below. Python also has a function called <code>type</code> that lets
	you find out the class of any data or expression...</p>

<pre data-echo="s07_ex2.py" data-title="1" class="Code">fiveText = "5"
fiveNum = <span class="Blue">float</span>(fiveText)
fiveInt = <span class="Blue">int</span>(fiveText)

print(2 * fiveText)     <span class="Comment"># 55</span>
print(2 * fiveNum)      <span class="Comment"># 10.0</span>
print(2 * fiveInt)      <span class="Comment"># 10</span>

print(type(fiveText))   <span class="Comment"># &lt;class 'str'&gt;</span>
print(type(fiveNum))    <span class="Comment"># &lt;class 'float'&gt;</span>
print(type(fiveInt))    <span class="Comment"># &lt;class 'int'&gt;</span></pre>

<p>When using Python’s <code>input</code> function to obtain user input, remember that
	the data will always be encoded as a <code>str</code>. If you want numerical input,
	you must use the <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> functions to convert the text
	data to the desired data type.</p>
<p>The program below will
	work as expected, as long as you provide input that can be converted to an integer.
	If you provided invalid input, the program will crash...</p>

<pre data-echo="s07_ex3.py" data-title="1" class="Code">num = <span class="Blue">int(</span>input("What is your favourite number? ")<span class="Blue">)</span>
print(2 * num)
print(2 + num)</pre>
