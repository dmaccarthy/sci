<p>To write your own programs, you will need several software tools:
<ul>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">text editor</em> to create and modify your programs. Ideally the editor should understand the programming language you are using so that it can help you write/fix programs.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">compiler</em> or <em class="Defn">interpreter</em> for the programming language you are using, to translate your programs into machine language.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">console</em> or <em class="Defn">desktop</em> to run the program in.</li>
    <li>A <em class="Defn">debugger</em> to track down errors.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An <em class="Defn">Integrated Development Environment</em> (IDE) is a program that collects all of these tools in a single place, to make your work as a programmer more productive. There are many different IDEâ€™s <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments" target="PyIDE">available for Python</a>.</p>
<p>The workstations in our computer lab have <em>Visual Studio Code</em> installed as the IDE. If you want to work at home, it is recommended that use the <em>Thonny</em> IDE since it is easy to install and is designed for novice programmers. If you want to use a different IDE, you may need to install both Python and the IDE separately, as well as additional software packages.</p>
<p>See the <a data-feed="cs_new/start">Getting Started</a> page for more details.</p>

<p class="Red">All files for <i>Structured Programming 1</i> must be saved in the <code>cs10/python</code> subfolder of your Computing Science OneDrive folder.</p>
<ol class="Assign">
<li>Open the file <code>s02_print.py</code> in <i>VS Code</i>. Type or paste the following program into the file.
<pre data-echo="s02_print.py" data-title="1" class="Code">print(5 * 2)</pre>
<p>Click the <i>Run</i> button to run the program and ensure that it works as it is supposed to. Then change the expression inside the parentheses and run it again. Does Python still give the correct answer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is a second example; this one accepts input from the keyboard...</p>
<pre data-echo="s02_name.py" data-title="1" class="Code">user = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {user}!")</pre>
<p>Copy this program into the file <code>s02_name.py</code> and ensure that you can run the program correctly. Do not make any changes to the program.</p>
</li>
