<h2 class="Collapse">Programming Tools</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p>To write your own programs, you will need several software tools:
<ul>
    <li>A <b class="Red">text editor</b> to create and modify your programs. Ideally the editor should understand the programming language you are using so that it can help you write/fix programs.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">compiler</b> or <b class="Red">interpreter</b> for the programming language you are using, to translate your programs into machine language.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">console</b> or <b class="Red">desktop</b> to run the program in.</li>
    <li>A <b class="Red">debugger</b> to track down errors.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An <b class="Red">Integrated Development Environment</b> (IDE) is a program that collects all of these tools in a single place, to make your work as a programmer more productive.
    There are many different IDE’s <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments" target="PyIDE">available for Python</a>, including...</p>

<section class="Post" data-icon="replit">
<h2 class="Collapse">replit</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p><a href="https://replit.com" target="repl">replit</a> is a cloud-based IDE. Your files are saved in the cloud and
    you can access them from any computer using a web browser (<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="Browser">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/" target="Browser">Mozilla Firefox</a> recommended).
    You do not need to install any software on your computer to write programs using replit.</p>
<p>You will need to create an account the first time you use replit. I recommend that you use your EIPS Google
    account to login to replit. Be sure to protect your privacy by not providing any information about yourself
    that you do not want to become public.</p>
<p>Once you have created an account, you can create your own coding projects (called “repls”) or create your own
    “fork” (copy) of any public projects. This IDE supports many different programming and markup languages.</p>

<section class="Post" data-icon="thonny">
<h2 class="Collapse">Thonny</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p>Thonny is a Python IDE designed for students who are new to programming. You may want to use Thonny instead of replit when
    writing programs that use graphics, since graphics-based programs tend to run slowly over the cloud. Any changes that you make
    to your project using Thonny will need to be uploaded to replit since Thonny does not sync files to the cloud automatically.</p>
<p>To use Thonny at home or on your own laptop, download and run the installer from the <a href="https://thonny.org" target="thonny">Thonny website</a>. A Python interpreter is included with Thonny so you do not need to install it separately.</p>
<p>After Thonny is installed, you will need to install the graphics and robotics software for this course. Go to Thonny’s “Tools” menu and select “Manage packages...” </p>

<ol>
    <li>Type the name of the software package, <code>sc8pr</code>.</li>
    <li>Click the button to search the Python Package Index (PyPI).</li>
    <li>Click the three dots.</li>
    <li>Select the desired version. This course assumes you are using the most recent update of <code>sc8pr 3.0</code>.</li>
    <li>Check “Upgrade Dependencies” and then click the Install button.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an error occurs while trying to install the packages, exit Thonny and re-open it <i>as an administrator</i>.</p></div></section>

<h2 class="Collapse">Other IDEs</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p>If you choose to use another IDE, you may need to install <a href="https://python.org/downloads">Python</a> first.</p>
<p>After installing Python, run the following command in your terminal program (may require admininstrator privileges) to install the graphics and robotics software you will need for this course:</p>
<pre data-echo="pip1.txt" data-title="Terminal Command" class="Code">pip3 install -U pip setuptools sc8pr</pre>
<p>On Windows, if the system does not recognize <code>pip3</code>, try typing the command as:</p>
<pre data-echo="pip2.txt" data-title="Terminal Command" class="Code">py -3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools sc8pr</pre>

<li><ol type="a">
    <li>Create an account and login to <a href="https://replit.com" target="replit">replit</a> using your <code>g.eips.ca</code> Google account.</li>
    <li>Open <a href="https://replit.com/@DavidMacCarthy/CS10-2024" target="replit">this link</a> and create a copy of the workspace for yourself using the “Fork” command.
        <p class="Center"><img class="Wide" src="./cs_new/sp1/img/fork.png" alt="replit Screen"/></p>
    </li>
    <li>Click the “Invite” button at the top right and enter your teacher’s email: <code class="Var">email</code>.</li>
    <!-- <li>In the “Tools” area, select “User Settings” and set the “Indentation character” to spaces and the “Indentation size” to 4.</li> -->
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Open the file <code>s02_print.py</code> in your copy of the repl and then type or copy-and-paste the code below into your program file.</p>
<pre data-echo="s02_print.py" data-title="1" class="Code">print(5 * 2)</pre>
<p>Run the program to ensure that it works as it is supposed to.</p>
<p>If replit runs a different file, click the menu button (the three dots) in the file browser and select “Show hidden files”. There will be a file called <code>.replit</code>. Open this file, and ensure that the <code>entrypoint</code> line looks like this:</p>
<pre data-echo="replit.txt" data-title="Plain Text" class="Code">entrypoint = "s02_print.py"</pre>
<p>When you want to run a different program, change the last part of this line to the file name that you want to run. Ensure that the quotes are not removed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is a second example; this one accepts input from the keyboard...</p>
<pre data-echo="s02_name.py" data-title="1" class="Code">user = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello, {}!".format(user))</pre>
<p>Copy this program into the file <code>s02_name.py</code> and ensure that you can run the program correctly.</p>
