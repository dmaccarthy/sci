<p>Complete both of the programming tasks below. Use VS Code to create, edit, and test your programs. Create the program files in the <code>cs10/python</code> folder of your Computing Science OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>All programs should have a docstring and relevant comments, and should use the “IPO” (Input, Processing, Output) program structure. Use descriptive names for variables.</p>
<p>Use only programming techniques that have been covered in these lessons. Examples that you find on the web often use
techniques that are considered bad programmming practice that should be avoided.</p>

<h2 class="Collapse">How Old Am I?</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p>Create a new file named <code>p1_age.py</code>.</p>
<p>Write a Python <em>console</em> program (i.e. do <b>not</b> use “Turtle graphics”!) that prompts the user to enter their year of birth, and some other year. The program should then calculate how old the user would be in the specified year.</p>
<p>The output of the program should be <em>exactly</em> as shown below when the input in blue is entered.</p>

<pre data-echo="io" class="Code">What year were you born? <span class="Blue">2010</span>
Enter another year. <span class="Blue">2112</span>

It's 2112.
Today is your birthday.
Your age is 102!</pre>

<h2 class="Collapse">Slice of Pie</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">
<p>Create a new file named <code>p1_pie.py</code>.</p>
<p>Use Python “Turtle graphics” to draw a slice of pie. The program should first use popup windows to ask the user to enter this pie size (radius) and the slice size (degrees). Let the user choose the flavour (colour) of the pie slice.</p>
<p>For example, if the user asks for a 200 pixel radius pie and a 45° slice, the program should draw the following.</p>
<p class="Center"><img src="cs_new/sp1/img/pie.webp"/></p>
<p>Use descriptive, user-friendly prompts and popup window captions.</p>
<p>Try to centre the pie slice in the Turtle window, and adjust the window size to the size of the pie.</p>
