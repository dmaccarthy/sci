<p>A computer is an electronic device that encodes and manipulates information as electronic signals.
	A <em class="Defn">program</em> is a set of instructions telling the computer what we want it to do.</p>

<p>On modern computers, programs are stored in the computerâ€™s memory as electronic signals called
	<em class="Defn">opcodes</em>. Programs written in this form are called <em class="Defn">machine
	language</em> programs. A machine language program appears as gibberish	to human readers, so it
	is not easy to write programs directly in machine language.</p>

<p>Computing scientists have invented many computer programming languages to make programming easier.
	Programming languages are often based on natural language and mathematics so that they are easier
	for humans to understand than machine language. Programming languages usually have strict
	<em class="Defn">syntax</em> (grammar and punctuation rules) that make them easier to translate
	into machine language.</p>

<p>Programs that you write must be translated into machine language before the computer is able to
	run them. There are two types of translator programs. <em class="Defn">Compilers</em> translate
	the entire program and then save the resulting machine language program.
	<em class="Defn">Interpreters</em> translate the instructions one at a time and then run them as
	they are translated, without saving the program in machine language form. Some of the most popular
	languages (e.g. Java and Python) take an intermediate approach, using a compiler to save a partial
	translation and an interpreter to run the program. Partially-compiled programs are sometimes
	called <em class="Defn">bytecode</em>.</p>

<p>Computing scientists may use the terms <em class="Defn">high-level</em> or
	<em class="Defn">low-level</em> when describing a programming language. High-level programming
	languages are those that resemble natural language more than machine language. These have the
	advantage of being easier for programmers to use and make programming quicker. Python and Java
	are both high-level programming languages. Low-level languages are closer to machine language and
	have the advantage of running more efficiently.</p>
