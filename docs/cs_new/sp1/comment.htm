<h2 class="Collapse">Comments</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p><b class="Red">Comments</b> are extra information added to your source code (program)
	to make it easier for human readers to understand. In Python, the <code>#</code> symbol
	is used to mark the beginning of a comment. The Python interpreter ignores everything
	from the <code>#</code> to the end of the line.</p>

<p>Here is an example from the previous lesson with four comment lines added to	explain what
    the program is doing.</p>

<pre data-echo="s04_ex1.py" data-title="1" class="Code">from turtle import setup, speed, pencolor, penup, pendown, left, forward, backward, exitonclick

<span class="Comment"># Set the canvas size, turtle speed, and pen color</span>
setup(600, 480)
speed(1)
pencolor("red")

<span class="Comment"># Move turtle into position</span>
penup()
backward(200)
left(45)

<span class="Comment"># Start drawing</span>
pendown()
forward(200)

<span class="Comment"># Finished!</span>
exitonclick()</pre>

<p>Comments can also be used to temporarily disable one or more instructions without
	actually deleting the code. If we want to see what the program would do if we took
	out the <code>penup()</code> instruction, we could add a <code>#</code> character to
	the beginning of the line. This is commonly called “commenting out” the instruction.</p>

<pre data-echo="py" class="Code">from turtle import setup, speed, pencolor, penup, pendown, left, forward, backward, exitonclick

<span class="Comment"># Set the canvas size, turtle speed, and pen color</span>
setup(600, 480)
speed(1)
pencolor("red")

<span class="Comment"># Move turtle into position</span>
<span class="Blue"># penup()</span>
backward(200)
left(45)

<span class="Comment"># Start drawing</span>
pendown()
forward(200)

<span class="Comment"># Finished!</span>
exitonclick()</pre>

<section class="Post" data-icon="python">
<h2 class="Collapse">Docstrings</h2><div class="Collapse Expand">

<p>Python allows programs to contain a special comment known as a
	<b class="Red">documentation string</b> or <b class="Red">docstring</b>.
	The purpose of the docstring is to describe the purpose of the program and to
	give additional information such as the author, version, copyright and license
	notices, etc.</p>

<p>The docstring is usually the first non-blank line in the file. Docstrings must be enclosed
    in quotation marks. If the docstring does not fit on a single line, it needs to be enclosed
    in <em>triple</em> quotes, as in the example below.</p>

<pre data-echo="py" class="Code"><span class="DocString">"""
An example of a Python 3 'Turtle Graphics' program.

Author: D. MacCarthy &lt;david.maccarthy@eips.ca&gt;

"""</span>
    
from turtle import setup, speed, pencolor, penup, pendown, left, forward, backward, exitonclick

<span class="Comment"># Set the canvas size, turtle speed, and pen color</span>
setup(600, 480)
speed(1)
pencolor("red")

<span class="Comment"># Move turtle into position</span>

left(45)

<span class="Comment"># Start drawing</span>

<p>Most IDE’s will display comments and docstrings in different colours from the
	program instructions to make them easy to identify.</p>
