<p>The <code>sc8pr</code> robotics package includes a simulation of two robots playing soccer.</p>

<p>The yellow robot is programmed to follow the soccer ball. The red robot will be controlled by a <code>brain</code> function that you write.</p>

<p>The robot’s front sensor will detect blue when pointed at the boards, yellow (different shades) when pointed at the opposing player or net, and red when pointed at its own net. Since the ball is half black and half white, it will register as grey on the colour sensor.</p>
<p>The downward sensor will detect yellow or red in the goal creases and green on the turf.</p>

<li>The yellow robot’s follow-the-ball program is not very effective; it’s just as likely to score
    on its own net as on its opponent. Can you create a better algorithm? Complete the red robot’s
    <code>brain</code> function to make it play against the yellow robot, using only its sensors and actuators.
    Do not access or modify the simulation code or reconfigure the robot’s sensors.</li>
