<section id="prob" class="Slide"><h3>Heat as a Fluid?</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Phlogiston</em>: A fluid that leaves a substance when it burns.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>This idea was discarded as some materials increase in mass when they burn.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Caloric</em>: A massless fluid that flows from hot to cold.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li><b>Count Rumford</b>: Observed that friction (e.g. drilling cannon bores) produced heat.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><b>Julius Meyer</b>: Observed that in warm climates, the body used less oxygen. This indicates that the body needs less energy.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><b>James Joule</b>: Conducted an experiment in which gravitational potential energy was used to stir water.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center" data-cue="="><img alt="Joule Apparatus" class="w24" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Joule%27s_Apparatus_%28Harper%27s_Scan%29.png/933px-Joule%27s_Apparatus_%28Harper%27s_Scan%29.png"/></p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>The water's temperature was observed to increase.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">It takes 4.19 joules (1 calorie) of energy to raise the temperature of each gram of water by 1°C.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Joule concluded that heat is related to energy!</li>

    <ul>
        <li>The atoms/molecules of every substance are in constant motion.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Temperature</em> is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these moving particles.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The temperature at which the particles have no kinetic energy at all is called <em class="Defn">absolute zero</em>.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Absolute zero or 0 Kelvin = –273.15°C.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">When objects at different temeratures are in contact, <em>collisions</em> between particles transfer energy from the hotter particles to the colder ones.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Pressure</em> is the force of the moving particles colliding with their container. Hotter temperatures produce higher pressures.</li>

<section id="phase" class="Slide"><h3>Phases of Matter</h3>
    <p class="Center"><iframe width="800" data-aspect="800/540" src="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/states-of-matter-basics/latest/states-of-matter-basics_all.html"></iframe></p>
    <p>Substances are in the gas phase (or state) when the molecules are far apart.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Molecules in gases travel long distances between collisions.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Gases expand to fill their container.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Gases exert more pressure at higher temperatures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">In the liquid phase, attractive forces between the molecules keep them in contact with neighbouring molecules.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>The forces are not strong enough to keep the individual molecules in place.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Liquids flow to take on the shape of their container.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Liquids maintain a fixed volume when their temperature is constant.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">When heated, liquids usually expand due to the extra kinetic energy each molecule has.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">In the solid phase, attractive forces keep the molecules from flowing.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Individual molecules vibrate in place.</li>
        <li>Solids maintain a fixed shape as well as volume.</li>
        <li>Like liquids, solids expand when heated as the molecules vibrate faster.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="therm2" class="Slide"><h3>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>It is not possible to extract all of the heat from a system and convert it entirely to other forms of energy.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Heat flows from higher to lower temperature.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Every energy transformation has an efficiency less than 100%.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">The “entropy” of any closed system can never decrease.</p>
