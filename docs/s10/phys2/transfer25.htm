<h1 id="Title">Heat Transfer</h1>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Heat Transfer</h3>
    <p>Heat flows from higher to lower temperatures. There are three main mechanisms of heat transfer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduction</li>
        <li>Convection</li>
        <li>Radiation</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Conduction</h3>
    <p>According to Kinetic-Molecular Theory, temperature measures the average kinetic energy of the particles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When two objects at different temperatures are <em>in contact</em> with each other, the particles will collide with each other.</li>
        <li>On average, the higher energy (hotter) particles lose energy and the lower energy (colder) particles gain energy.</li>
        <li>There is a flow of heat from hot to cold.</li>
        <li>This mechanism of heat transfer is called <em class="Defn">conduction</em>.</li>
        <li>Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases.</li>
        <li>Some materials, like most metals, are better conductors of heat.</li>
        <li>Insulators, like styrofoam and fibreglass, are poor conductors of heat.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Convection</h3>
    <p>In fluids (liquids and gases), heat can be transported via <em class="Defn">convection</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most fluids expand (become less dense) when heated.</li>
        <li>Hotter regions will be more buoyant and will rise.</li>
        <li>Colder parts of the fluid will be drawn in to replace the rising hotter fluid.</li>
        <li>The net result of this effect will be a <em class="Defn">convection current</em>.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Radiation</h3>
    <p>Objects that are really hot emit light and other forms of <em class="Defn">electromagnetic radiation</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Since light is a form of energy, radiation results in a decrease of temperature.</li>
        <li>When the light strikes another object, that object gains energy.</li>
        <li>At the temperature of the Sun (5800 K), objects radiate all colours of the rainbow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center"><img class="w16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Rainbow_30737_20130815160755.JPG/800px-Rainbow_30737_20130815160755.JPG"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>At even hotter temperatures, there is more radiation produced at the violet end of the spectrum and into the untraviolet.</li>
        <li>At lower temperatures, less violet light is produced and the light appears orange or red.</li>
        <li>Room temperature objects emit <em class="Defn">infrared radiation</em>; radiation like light but with a wavelength to long to be visible.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Systems</h3>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">open system</em> is one that allows <em>both</em> energy and matter into and out of the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A mug of hot chocolate would be classified as an open system.</li>
        <li>You can add energy by microwaving it.</li>
        <li>You can remove energy by allowing it to transfer heat into the air.</li>
        <li>You can add matter by adding marshmallows or more water.</li>
        <li>You can remove matter by drinking some.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">closed system</em> is one that allows <em>energy</em> into and out of the system but <em>not</em> matter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth is very close to being a closed system.</li>
        <li>Radiation from the Sun adds energy.</li>
        <li>Earth emits its own radiation which removes energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">isolated system</em> allows <em>neither</em> energy nor mass to enter or leave the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The only truly isolated system is the universe in its entirety.</li>
        <li>Scientists sometimes use the concept of an isolated as an idealization.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Budget</h3>
    <p>For Earth’s climate system, the heat added is almost exclusively radiation (light, UV, IR) from the Sun.</p>
    <p>The heat lost is almost exclusively infrared radiation from Earth into space.</p>
    <p>Convection currents in the oceans and atmosphere are responsible for distributing heat around the globe.</p>
    <p>According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, if the heat added does not exactly balance the heat lost, there will be a change in the temperature of the system.</p>
    <p>Earth’s <em class="Defn">radiation budget</em> is an accounting of where the incoming energy goes, and where the outgoing radiation comes from...</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Greenhouse Effect</h3>
    <p>The Sun (5800 K) is nealy 20 times hotter than the Earth (300 K).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This means that the radiation emitted by Earth is very different from radiation emitted by the Sun.</li>
        <li>The Sun emits mostly visible light, with some infrared and ultraviolet radiation.</li>
        <li>Earth emits only “far infrared” radiation that has a wavelength about 20 times longer than visible light.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Earth’s atmosphere contains CO<sub>2</sub>, water, methane, and other <em class="Defn">greenhouse gases</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These gases allow sunlight to pass through, but absorb infrared radiation from the ground.</li>
        <li>When the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere changes, it will affect the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.</li>
        <li>More greehouse gases means less infrared radiation can escape the Earth; but the incoming energy will not be affected.</li>
        <li>This would cause a rise in average temperature.</li>
        <li>Earth would be much colder if there were no greenhouse gases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em class="Defn">Feedbacks</em> can amplify warming effects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Melting glaciers and increased deserts can make Earth lesss reflective.</li>
        <li>Warmer temperatures can release more greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- <section class="Slide"><h3>Heat &amp; Climate</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Radiation received from the Sun adds heat to the Earth’s climate system.</li>
        <li>Radiation emitted by the Earth removes heat to the Earth’s climate system.</li>
        <li>Convection currents in the atmosphere and the oceans play an important role in distributing heat around the Earth.</li>

<h2 class="Collapse">Review</h2><div class="Collapse">
<ol>
    <li>Explain what <em class="Defn">conduction</em> is and give examples of heat transfer by conduction.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Conduction is the transfer of heat by contact between materials. When the molecules of the hotter object collide with molecules of the colder object, there is a net transfer of thermal energy.</p>

    <li>Explain how <em class="Defn">convection</em> works.</li>
    <p class="Answer">When a fluid (liquid or gas) is heated, it usually expands to become less dense that the surrounding fluid. The warmer fluid rises and is replaced by cooler fluid. These convection currents help distribute heat more effectively.</p>

    <li>Explain how <em class="Defn">radiation</em> transfers heat.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation which carries away energy. When the EMR is absorbed by another object the energy is absorbed. The type of EMR depends on the temperature of the emitting object. Objects close to room temperature emit infrared radiation, while objects near the temperature of the Sun emit visible light.</p>

<!-- Added from clim1/budget -->

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">open</em>, <em class="Defn">closed</em> and <em class="Defn">isolated</em> systems. Which type of system is Earth?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Open = Matter and energy can both leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Closed = Energy (but not matter) can leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Isolated = Neither energy nor matter can leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Earth is <em>nearly</em> a closed system; a very small amount of matter enters or leaves.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Why and how is the incoming radiation that Earth receives from the Sun different from the outgoing radiation that Earth sends into space?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The Sun is about 20 times hotter than the Earth, so it emits mostly visible, ultraviolet, and some infrared radiation. Earth emits almost entirely IR.</p>

    <li>What do we mean by Earth’s <em class="Defn">radiation budget</em>? According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, what must happen if the incoming and outgoing radiation do not balance?</li>
    <p class="Answer">This refers to the balance among incoming, reflected, absorbed, and emitted radiation by Earth. According to the Laws of THermodynamics, if there is a difference between the total incoming and outgoing energy, the average temerature of the climate system must change.</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Describe the <em class="Defn">greenhouse effect</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Incoming radiation in the Sun is primarily visible light which passes through the atmosphere easily. Outgoing radiation from Earth is infrared, much of which is absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases in the atmosphere. Since these greenhouse gases affect outgoing but not incoming radiation, they alter the energy budget balance.
        </p>

        <li>How would Earth’s climate be different if there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?</li>
        <p class="Answer">It would be much colder as more infrared radiation would carry energy away from the Earth.</p>
