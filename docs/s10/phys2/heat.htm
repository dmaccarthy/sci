<section class="Slide"><h3>Heat as a Fluid?</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Phlogiston</em>: A fluid that leaves a substance when it burns.</p>
    <ul><li>This idea was discarded as some materials increase in mass when they burn.</li></ul>
    <p><em class="Defn">Caloric</em>: A massless fluid that flows from hot to cold.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Count Rumford</b>: Observed that friction (e.g. drilling cannon bores) produced heat.</li>
        <li><b>Julius Meyer</b>: Observed that in warm climates, the body used less oxygen. This indicates that the body needs less energy.</li>
        <li><b>James Joule</b>: Conducted an experiment in which gravitational potential energy was used to stir water.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center"><img alt="Joule Apparatus" class="w24" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Joule%27s_Apparatus_%28Harper%27s_Scan%29.png/933px-Joule%27s_Apparatus_%28Harper%27s_Scan%29.png"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The water's temperature was observed to increase.</li>
        <li>It takes 4.19 joules (1 calorie) of energy to raise the temperature of each gram of water by 1°C.</li>
        <li>Joule concluded that heat is related to energy!</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Kinetic Molecular Theory</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The atoms/molecules of every substance are in constant motion.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Temperature</em> is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these moving particles.</li>
        <li>The temperature at which the particles have no kinetic energy at all is called <em class="Defn">absolute zero</em>.</li>
        <li>Absolute zero or 0 Kelvin = –273.15°C.</li>
        <li>When objects at different temeratures are in contact, <em>collisions</em> between particles transfer energy from the hotter particles to the colder ones.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Pressure</em> is the force of the moving particles colliding with their container. Hotter temperatures produce higher pressures.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Phases of Matter</h3>
    <p class="Center"><iframe width="800" data-aspect="80/54" src="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/states-of-matter-basics/latest/states-of-matter-basics_all.html"></iframe></p>
    <p>Substances are in the gas phase (or state) when the molecules are far apart.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Molecules in gases travel long distances between collisions.</li>
        <li>Gases expand to fill their container.</li>
        <li>Gases exert more pressure at higher temperatures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the liquid phase, attractive forces between the molecules keep them in contact with neighbouring molecules.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The forces are not strong enough to keep the individual molecules in place.</li>
        <li>Liquids flow to take on the shape of their container.</li>
        <li>Liquids maintain a fixed volume when their temperature is constant.</li>
        <li>When heated, liquids usually expand due to the extra kinetic energy each molecule has.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the solid phase, attractive forces keep the molecules from flowing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individual molecules vibrate in place.</li>
        <li>Solids maintain a fixed shape as well as volume.</li>
        <li>Like liquids, solids expand when heated as the molecules vibrate faster.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>It is not possible to extract all of the heat from a system and convert it entirely to other forms of energy.</p>
    <p>Heat flows from higher to lower temperature.</p>
    <p>Every energy transformation has an efficiency less than 100%.</p>
    <p>The “entropy” of any closed system can never decrease.</p>

<h2 class="Collapse">Review</h2>
<div id="Review" class="Collapse">
<ol>
    <li>Discuss the contributions of Count Rumford, Julius Meyer, and James Joule to our understanding of <em class="Defn">heat</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Rumford: Disproved “caloric” theory by showing that heat could be generated by friction.</p>
        <p>Meyer: Demonstrated that the body needs less energy in warm climates (more oxygen in blood).</p>
        <p>Joule: Demonstrated that heat could be generated from mechanical energy.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Describe the <em class="Defn">phlogiston</em> and <em class="Defn">caloric</em> theories of heat and explain why those theories were discarded.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Both proposed that heat was an invisible fluid. These theories could not explain why some materials gain mass when they burn or how friction between two cold objects could produce heat.</div>

    <li>Explain how the theory of atoms and molecules can be used to understand the difference between solids, liquids, and gases. Include illustrations.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Solids have fixed shapes; the particles do not have enough energy to move past their neighbours.</p>
        <p>Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container; they are still bounds to their neighbours but have enough energy to move around.</p>
        <p>Gases expand to fill their container; particles have sufficient energy to escape the forces trying to bind them to their neighbours.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Explain how <em class="Defn">kinetic molecular theory</em> explains the concept of temperature.</li>
    <div class="Answer">The molecules of a substance are constantly in motion. Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of these particles.</div>

    <li>Explain the difference between <em class="Defn">thermal energy</em>, <em class="Defn">heat</em> and <em class="Defn">temperature</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of the molecules, not just the average. Heat means a transfer of thermal energy from one place to another.</div>

    <li>State the <em class="Defn">First</em> and <em class="Defn">Second Laws of Thermodynamics</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>1st: Energy is conserved; it cannot be created or destroyed.</p>
        <p>2nd: It is not possible to extract all of the thermal energy and convert it to useful energy; energy transformations tend to be less than 100% efficient.</p>
    </div>

    <li>Explain how kinetic molecular theory predicts that gases will exert <em class="Defn">pressure</em> trying to expand their container, and why hotter gases exert more pressure.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Whenever a molecule collides with its container, it exerts a small amount of outward force. The combined force of all the gas molecules creates the pressure that causes the gas to expand. At higher temperatures, molecules are moving faster so they produce more force when they collide.</div>
