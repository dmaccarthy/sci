<h1 id="Title">Work-Energy Theorem</h1>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Work-Energy Theorem</h3>
    <p>We saw in the last lesson that the amount of mechanical energy that a force transforms is called the <em class="Defn">work</em> done.</p>
    <div>
        <p>An important Physics concepts is the <em class="Defn">Work-Energy Theorem</em>, which allows us to calculate work using this equation:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W=\Delta E_k=\vec{\bf{F}}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf{d}}</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>If you were to push an object 2.0 metres by applying a force of 10 newtons in the same direction that it is moving, you would be doing 20 joules of work.</li>
        <li>If this happened in deep space where there were no other forces acting, the object would gain 20 joules of kinetic energy.</li>
        <li>On Earth, we would need to account for the work being done by gravity, friction, and any other forces before we could say how much kinetic energy was gained.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p class="Blue">The kinetic energy of a wagon increases from 10 J to 25 J as a student pulls it 3.0 metres. How much force is the student applying?</p>
    <div>
        <p>Determine how much work was done by calculating the change in kinetic energy:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W=\Delta E_k= \rm{25\ J - 10\ J = 15\ J}</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Rearrange the work-energy equation to find force:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W = \vec{\bf{F}}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf{d}}</p>
    </div>
    <p class="TeX">\vec{\bf F} = {W \over \Delta\vec{\bf d}} = \rm{{15\ J\over +3.0\ m} = +5.0\ N}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This answer assumes that there are no other forces affecting the energy.</li>
        <li>If the wagon is on a hill, or if there is friction or air resistance, the answer would be different.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Force Not Constant?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Using the work-energy equation requires a <em>constant</em> amount of force:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W = \vec{\bf{F}}\cdot\Delta\vec{\bf{d}}</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>If the force is <em>not</em> constant, we can calculate work as the <u>area under a graph</u> of <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}</span> vs <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}</span>.</li>
        <li>This calculation effectively averages the force. (Examples p155-156.)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p class="Blue">When a tennis racket hits a ball, the force increases as the racket strings stretch, and then decreases as it unstretches. How much work does the racket do on the ball?</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-svg2="s10/phys2/img/we.js#tennis" class="w28"></svg></p>
    <div>
        <p>For the first 5.0 cm of the motion, the graph is triangular:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W = \rm \frac{Base × Height}{2} = \frac{0.050\ m × 35.0\ N}{2} = 0.875\ J</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>For the next 2.0 cm (from 5.0 to 7.0), the graph is rectangular:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W = \rm Base × Height = 0.020\ m × 35.0\ N = 0.700\ J</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>For the last 3.0 cm (from 7.0 to 10.0), the graph is triangular:</p>
        <p class="TeX">W = \rm \frac{Base × Height}{2} = \frac{0.030\ m × 35.0\ N}{2} = 0.525\ J</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The total work done (kinetic energy gained!) is:</p>
        <p class="TeX">\Sigma W = \rm (0.875 + 0.700 + 0.525)\ J = 2.1\ J</p>
    </div>
