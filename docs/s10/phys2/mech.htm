<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Energy</em> is “the ability to do work” or “the ability to create motion”.</p>
    <p>Energy comes in many forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em class="Defn">Chemical Energy</em> is associated with the arrangement of atoms in a substance.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Nuclear Energy</em> is associated with the arrangement of protons and neutrons within a nucleus.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Thermal Energy</em> and <em class="Defn">Sound Waves</em> are forms of energy associated with the movement of molecules within a substance.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Light</em> (including other forms of “electromagnetic radiation” like x-rays and radio waves) is a form of energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the above are <u>non-mechanical</u> forms of energy because they are unrelated to an object’s motion.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Mechanical Energy</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Mechanical</em> forms of energy are types of energy that <b>are</b> related to an object’s motion.</p>
    <p>There are two mechanical forms of energy that we will study in Science 10:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kinetic energy</li>
        <li>Gravitational potential energy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other types of mechanical energy that we will study in Physics 20 include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rotational energy</li>
        <li>Elastic potential energy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All forms of energy are scalar quantities.</p>
    <p>The SI unit for energy is the joule (J).</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>
    <p>When an object is in motion, it has <em class="Defn">Kinetic Energy</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We can calculate kinetic energy using the equation:<p class="TeX">E_k={1\over 2}mv^2</p></li>
        <li><span class="TeX">m</span> is the object’s mass in <u>kilo</u>grams. A larger mass has more energy than a smaller mass when moving at the same speed.</li>
        <li><span class="TeX">v</span> is the object’s speed in m/s. Objects have more energy when they are moving at faster speeds.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>
    <p>When an object is elevated above the ground, it has <em class="Defn">Gravitational Potential Energy</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We can calculate gravitational potential energy using the equation:<p class="TeX">E_g=mgh</p></li>
        <li><span class="TeX">m</span> is the object’s mass in <u>kilo</u>grams.</li>
        <li><span class="TeX">g</span> is the strength of gravity, which is <span class="TeX">\rm{9.81 m/s^2}</span> on Earth, near the ground.</li>
        <li><span class="TeX">h</span> is the object’s height in metres above the origin.</li>
        <li>When an object rises above the ground, gravity transforms its kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy.</li>
        <li>When an object falls, gravity transforms its gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A player kicks a 600-gram soccer ball. When the ball is 2.00 metres above the ground, its speed is 3.00 m/s.</p>
    <ul><li class="Blue">What is the ball’s <em>kinetic</em> energy?</li></ul>
    <p class="TeX Answer">\begin{align}E_k &= {1\over 2}mv^2
        \\[8pt]&= {1\over 2}\rm{0.600\ kg\cdot(3.00\ m/s)^2}
        \\[8pt]&= \rm{2.70\ J}\end{align}</p>
    <ul><li class="Blue">What is the ball’s <em>gravitational potential</em> energy?</li></ul>
    <p class="TeX Answer">\begin{align}E_g &= mgh
        \\[8pt]&= \rm{0.600\ kg \cdot 9.81\ m/s^2 \cdot 2.00\ m}
        \\[8pt]&= \rm{11.8\ J}\end{align}</p>
    <ul><li class="Blue">How much <em>mechanical</em> energy does the ball have?</li></ul>
    <p class="TeX Answer">E = E_k + E_g = \rm{2.70\ J + 11.8\ J = 14.5\ J}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">Calculate the height of a 750-gram football when it has 20.0 joules of gravitational potential energy.</p>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p>We need to use algebra to isolate the unknown (<span class="TeX">h</span>) before we can complete the calculation:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_g = mgh</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{E_g}{\color{red}{mg}} = \frac{mgh}{\color{red}{mg}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{E_g}{\color{red}{mg}} = \frac{\cancel{mg}h}{\cancel{\color{red}{mg}}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{E_g}{mg} = h</p>
    <p class="TeX">h = \rm{\frac{20.0\ J}{0.750\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2} = 2.72\ m}</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 3</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">Calculate the speed of the football when it has 35.0 joules of kinetic energy.</p>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p>We need to use algebra to isolate the unknown (<span class="TeX">v</span>) before we can complete the calculation:</p>
    <p class="TeX">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{\color{red}2 E_k}{\color{red}m} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \cdot \color{red}{\frac{2}{m}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{\color{red}2 E_k}{\color{red}m} = \frac{1}{\cancel 2}\cancel mv^2 \cdot \color{red}{\frac{\cancel 2}{\cancel m}}</p>
    <p class="TeX">\frac{2E_k}{m} = v^2</p>
    <p>To cancel the “squared”, we need to square root both sides:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\sqrt{\frac{2E_k}{m}} = \sqrt{v^2} = v</p>
    <p class="TeX">v = \rm{\sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 35.0\ J}{0.750\ kg}} = 9.66\ m/s}</p>
