<section class="Slide"><h3>First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy is a conserved quantity.</li>
        <li>Energy cannot be created or destroyed.</li>
        <li>Energy can be transformed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>There are several different ways of describing the Second Law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is not possible to extract all of the thermal energy from a system.</li>
        <li>The efficiency of any energy transformation will always be less than 100%.</li>
        <li>Heat flows naturally from higher to lower temperatures.</li>
        <li>To force heat to flow in the wrong direction (as in a refrigerator or air conditioner) requires adding work to the system.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Efficiency</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Efficiency</em> describes how much <em>useful</em> energy is produced by an energy transformation compared to the input energy:</p>
    <p class="TeX">\epsilon = \left|{\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}\right|</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The type(s) of energy that are considered “useful” depends on the purpose of the energy transformation.</li>
        <li>For example, the purpose of a car engine is to move the car, so kinetic energy would be considered “useful” energy.</li>
        <li>Any sound or thermal energy produced by the engine would be considered “wasted” energy.</li>
        <li>The input would be the chemical energy of the gasoline, propane, diesel fuel, or battery.</li>
        <li>Efficiency is often expressed as a percentage; multiply by 100% to convert a decimal to a percentage and divide by 100% for the opposite conversion.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 50.0 kg skier starts from the top of a 10.0 m tall hill.
        At the bottom if the hill, her speed is 12.0 m/s. What is the efficiency of the energy transformation?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Input is gravitational potential energy:<p class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \mathrm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 10.0\ m = 4905\ J}</p></li>
        <li>Useful output is kinetic energy:<p class="TeX">E_k = {1\over 2}mv^2 = \mathrm{{1\over 2}(50.0\ kg) (12.0\ m/s)^2 = 3600\ J}</p></li>
        <li>Efficiency is:<p class="TeX">\epsilon = \left|{\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}\right| = \mathrm{3600\ J\over 4905\ J} = 0.734</p></li>
        <li>73.4% of the energy input (<span class="TeX">E_g</span>) gets transformed into useful energy (<span class="TeX">E_k</span>).</li>
        <li>26.6% of the energy input (<span class="TeX">E_g</span>) gets transformed into waste (sound or thermal energy).</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="Collapse">Practice &amp; Review</h2><div id="Review" class="Collapse">
<ul><li>Complete questions #1-9 on page 227 of <i>ScienceFocus 10</i>. Answer key is on page 485 (Chapter 6 section).</li></ul>
<ol>
    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What do we mean by <em class="Defn">useful</em> and <em class="Defn">waste</em> energy?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The <em>useful</em> energy is the type of energy that is the intended purpose of the energy transformation. The <em>waste</em> refers to other forms of energy, often thermal energy, sound, and light, which are by-products of the energy transformation.</p>
    
        <li>What do we mean by the <em class="Defn">input</em> energy?</li>
        <p class="Answer">This is the source of energy, often chemical or electrical, that is transformed into the useful and waste outputs.</p>
    
        <li>According to the <em class="Defn">First Law of Thermodynamics</em>, how are the input, useful output, and waste energies related during any energy transformation?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The total of the useful and waste outputs must always equal the input energy.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define <em class="Defn">efficiency</em>. Include the equation used to calculate efficiency and an explanation of what it means.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p><em>Efficiency</em> is the ratio of the useful energy produced compared to the input energy. The closer the effciency is to 100%, the less energy is being wasted.</p>
            <p class="TeX">\epsilon = \left|{\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}\right|</p>
        </div>
        <li>Does efficiency have units? Explain.</li>
        <p class="Answer">No! The numerator and denominator are both energies, so the units cancel.</p>
    
        <li>Explain how to convert efficiency between a decimal and percentage.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Multiply by 100% to convert a decimal to a percentage. Divide by 100% to convert a percentage to a decimal.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Explain how efficiency is related to the <em class="Defn">Second Law of Thermodynamics</em>.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Energy transformations are almost never 100% efficient; there is always some thermal energy produced.</p>
