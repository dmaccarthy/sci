<section id="law1" class="Slide"><h3>First Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="1">Energy is a conserved quantity.</li>
        <li data-cue="2">Energy cannot be created or destroyed.</li>
        <li data-cue="3">Energy can be transformed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="law2" class="Slide"><h3>Second Law of Thermodynamics</h3>
    <p>There are several different ways of describing the Second Law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="1">It is not possible to extract all of the thermal energy from a system.</li>
        <li data-cue="2">The efficiency of any energy transformation will always be less than 100%.</li>
        <li data-cue="3">Heat flows naturally from higher to lower temperatures.</li>
        <li data-cue="4">To force heat to flow in the wrong direction (as in a refrigerator or air conditioner) requires adding work to the system.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="eff" class="Slide"><h3>Efficiency</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Efficiency</em> describes how much useful energy is produced by an energy transformation compared to the input energy:
        <p class="TeX">\epsilon = \left|{\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}\right|</p></p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="1">The type(s) of energy that are considered “useful” depends on the purpose of the energy transformation.</li>
        <li data-cue="2">For example, the purpose of a car engine is to move the car, so kinetic energy would be considered “useful” energy.</li>
        <li data-cue="3">Any sound or thermal energy produced by the engine would be considered “wasted” energy.</li>
        <li data-cue="4">The input would be the chemical energy of the gasoline, propane, diesel fuel, or battery.</li>
        <li data-cue="5">Efficiency is often expressed as a percentage; multiply by 100% to convert a decimal to a percentage and divide by 100% for the opposite conversion.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="ex1" class="Slide"><h3>Example</h3>
    <p class="Blue">A 50.0 kg skier starts from the top of a 10.0 m tall hill.
        At the bottom if the hill, her speed is 12.0 m/s. What is the efficiency of the energy transformation?</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="1">Input is gravitational potential energy:<p class="TeX">E_g = mgh = \mathrm{50.0\ kg\cdot 9.81\ m/s^2\cdot 10.0\ m = 4905\ J}</p></li>
        <li data-cue="2">Useful output is kinetic energy:<p class="TeX">E_k = {1\over 2}mv^2 = \mathrm{{1\over 2}(50.0\ kg) (12.0\ m/s)^2 = 3600\ J}</p></li>
        <li data-cue="3">Efficiency is:<p class="TeX">\epsilon = \left|{\Delta E_{useful} \over \Delta E_{input}}\right| = \mathrm{3600\ J\over 4905\ J} = 0.734</p></p>
        <li data-cue="4">73.4% of the energy input (<span class="TeX">E_g</span>) gets transformed into useful energy (<span class="TeX">E_k</span>).</li>
        <li data-cue="5">26.6% of the energy input (<span class="TeX">E_g</span>) gets transformed into waste (sound or thermal energy).</li>
    </ul>
