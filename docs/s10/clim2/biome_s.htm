<section id="biome" class="Slide"><h3>Biomes</h3>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">biome</em> is a geographic region that has characteric types of <em class="Defn">flora</em> (plants) and <em class="Defn">fauna</em> (animals).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, cactus plants are characteristic of a <em>desert</em> biome while polar bears are characteristic of the <em>tundra</em>.</li>
        <li>Biomes are also called <em class="Defn">ecozones</em>.</li>
        <li>Land-based biomes are called <em class="Defn">terrestrial</em> biomes.</li>
        <li>Water-based biomes are called <em class="Defn">aquatic</em> biomes.</li>
        <li>The term <em class="Defn">marine</em> can be used to describe ocean (saltwater) biomes.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="clim" class="Slide"><h3>Biomes &amp; Climate</h3>
    <p>Climate (hot or cold, wet or dry) is a key factor in determining which organisms are present.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cactus plants are found in hot, dry areas.</li>
        <li>Polar bears are found in cold, dry areas adjacent to the ocean.</li>
        <li>Plants and animals are less likely to thrive in environments to which they are not <em>adapted</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="adapt" class="Slide"><h3>Adaptations</h3>
    <p>Features that plants and animals have that make them suited to their environment are called <em class="Defn">adaptations</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em class="Defn">Physiological</em> adaptations are related to the internal workings (e.g. metabolism and other biochemistry) of the organism.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Structural</em> adaptations are related to the physical features of an organism.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Behavioural</em> adaptations refer to how an animals behaviour helps it survive and thrive in its environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Polar bears can communicate through body language and vocalizations... <em class="Red">Behavioual</em></p>
    <p>Polar bears have white fur that camouflage them against the snow in the tundra, helping them to hunt for food... <em class="Red">Structural</em></p>
    <p>Some polar bears hibernate during the long, cold winter when food is scarce... <em class="Red">Physiological</em></p>
