    <li>What do we call the study of past climates?</li>
    <div class="Answer">Paleoclimatology</div>

    <li>Identify three sources of evidence that scientists use to reconstruct Canada’s past climate.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Glacial Ice Cores, Pollen preserved in amber, Tree Rings, Plant Fossils, Lake Sediments</div>

    <li>Describe the climate change and its effects that have occurred in Canada.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Permafrost Thaw, Pine Beetles, Forest Fires, Floods & Droughts</div>

    <li>Describe in detail six natural causes of climate change.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Change in Axis Tilt, Change in Orbit, Continental Drift, Weathering, Meteor Strike, Volcanic Events</div>

    <li>Describe and give an example of a positive feedback related to natural climate change.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Positive feedback is when a change has effects that make that change even bigger. For example, higher temperatures may cause thawing of permafrost which releases methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas that can lead to more warming. Melting glaciers and sea ice can decrease albedo (reflection of sunlight) increasing the amount of heat absorbed by the Earth.</div>

    <li>Describe and give an example of a negative feedback related to natural climate change.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Negative feedback is when a change has effects that make that change smaller. For example, increased temperature can cause more evaporation leading to greater cloud cover. Clouds can increase the albedo (more reflection of solar radiation) which may reduce warming. When the temperature rises, Earth emmits more infrared radiation thereby losing more heat.</div>

    <li>Explain and give an example of how sudden changes in climate can have disastrous results.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Mass Extinction</div>
