<h3>Characteristics of Life</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Need energy: eat, photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>Produce wastes.</li>
    <li>Grow.</li>
    <li>Reproduce.</li>
    <li>Respond: to the environment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Abiogenesis</h3>
<p>Aristotle observed frogs in mud, and mice in wheat husks.</p>
<ul>
    <li>He hypothesized the <em class="Defn">spontaneous generation</em> of these animals from non-living material.</li>
    <li>Spontaneous generation is also called <em class="Defn">abiogenesis:</em></li>
    <ul>
        <li>genesis = creation</li>
        <li>bio = life</li>
        <li>a = not, opposite</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Redi (1668) used a controlled experiment with flies to <b>disprove</b> abiogenesis.</li>
    <li>The experiment tested whether maggots could arise from rotting meat by covering one jar of meat and leaving the other uncovered.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Maggots developed in the open jars only meat but not in the covered jars.</li>
    <li>This shows that something from outside (flies!) produced the maggots, and covering the jar prevented this.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide">
<h3>Biogenesis</h3>
<p class="Bold">Living organisms can only arise from other living organisms.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The theory of <em class="Defn">biogenesis</em> was proposed by Virchow (1858).</li>
    <li>Pasteur (1850) studied fermentation and sour milk caused by microorganisms.</li>
    <li>He showed that you could slow the spoiling of milk by preventing microorganisms from entering, and by killing exiting microbes with heat.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide">
<h3>Cell Theory</h3>
<p>Schleiden, Schwann, & Virchow proposed the basics of cell theory...</p>
<ol>
    <li>All organisms are composed of one or more cells.</li>
    <li>The cell is the smallest functional unit of life. (Just like atoms are the smallest unit of matter in chemistry)</li>
    <li>All cells are produced from other cells.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Define <em class="Defn">abiogenesis</em> and <em class="Defn">biogenesis</em>.</li>
<p class="Answer">Abiogenesis is the idea that life can arise from non-living matter. Biogenesis says that life can only arise from living things.</p>

<li>Describe <em class="Defn">Redi’s experiment</em> including a diagram. State what the manipulated, responding, and controlled variables were. What was his conclusion?</li>
<div class="Answer">
    <p>Place meat (Controlled) in covered and uncovered jars (Manipulated).</p>
    <p>Maggots (Responding) appear only in the uncovered jar.</p>
    <p>Conclusion: Maggots did not arise from the meat but from the flies.</p>
</div>

<li>Describe the contributions to cell theory of:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Robert Hooke</li>
    <p class="Answer">Saw cork cells in a primitive microscope and coined the term “cell”.</p>

    <li>Anton von Leeuwenhoek</li>
    <p class="Answer">Improved the microscope design and saw single-celled organisms in his microscope.</p>

    <li>Louis Pasteur</li>
    <p class="Answer">Demonstrated that microorganisms caused food spoilage but did not arise from the food itself.</p>

    <li>Schleiden & Schwann</li>
    <p class="Answer">Concluded that all plant and animal tissues are composed of cells.</p>

    <li>Rudolf Virchow</li>
    <p class="Answer">Concluded that cells are created from pre-existing cells.</p>
</ol></li>

<li>State the three basic principles of <em class="Defn">cell theory</em>.</li>
<ol class="Answer">
    <li>All organisms (life) are composed of one or more cells.</li>
    <li>The cell is the smallest functional unit of life.</li>
    <li>All cells are produced from other cells.</li>
