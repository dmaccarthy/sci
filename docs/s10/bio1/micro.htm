<h3>Microscopes and the Cell Discoveries</h3>
<p>Robert Hooke (1665) used a rudimentary microscope (30×) to observe cork from trees.</p>

<h3>Compound Light Microscope</h3>
<p>A <em class="Defn">compound microscope</em> is made from two lenses...</p>
<ul>
    <li>The lens that you look into is called the <em class="Defn">eyepiece</em> or <em class="Defn">ocular lens</em>.</li>
    <li>The lens closer to the specimen you are viewing is called the <em class="Defn">objective lens</em>.</li>
    <li>Each lens bends the light that passss through it to produce a magnified image.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">magnification</em> of the microscope is the <em>product</em> of the objective and ocular magnifications.</li>
    <li>Many microscope provide multiple objective lenses to choose from.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide">
<h3>Field of View</h3>
<p>The <em class="Defn">field of view</em> means the actual (unmagnified) diameter of what you see when you look through the eyepiece.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can often measure the field of view under lowest magnification by observing a ruler marked in millimetres.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">image size</em> means how big the magnified image is.</li>
    <li>You can calculate the image size by <em>multiplying</em> the field of view by the magnification.</li>
    <li>Under higher magnification, the field of view <em>decreases</em> in proportion to the magnification.</li>
    <li>For example, when you change the magnification from 40× to 200×, the field of view gets 5 times smaller because the magnification is 5 times larger.</li>
    <li>The image size does not change!</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p class="Blue">A compound light microscope has an eyepiece with a magnification of 12× and a lower power objective with a magnification of 5×. Students place a transparent ruler under the mimcroscope on low power and measure the field of view to be 3.0 mm. Calculate the low power magnification and the image size.</p>
    <p class="Center">Magnification = (Ocular Power) × (Objective Power)</p>
    <p class="Center">= 12 × 5 = 60</p>
    <p class="Center">Image Size = (FoV) × (Magnification)</p>
    <p class="Center">= 3.0 mm × 60 = 180 mm = 18 cm</p>
    <p class="Blue">The high power objective of the microscope has a magnification of 60×. Determine the field of view under high power.</p>
    <p class="Center">Magnification = (Ocular Power) × (Objective Power)</p>
    <p class="Center">= 12 × 60 = 720</p>
    <p class="Center">FoV = (Image Size) ÷ (Magnification)</p>
    <p class="Center">= 180 mm ÷ 720 = 0.25 mm</p>

    <h3>Other Microscopes</h3>
    <p>In addition to compound light microscopes, there are several other types of microscopes that scientists can use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transmission Electron Microscope</li>
        <li>Scanning Electron Microscope</li>
        <li>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope</li>
        <li>Scanning Tunnelling Microscope</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These different types of microscopes can produce higher magnification and/or higher resolutions than a compound light microscope.</p>

<h2 class="Collapse">Practice</h2><div class="Collapse">
<ol>
    <li>A microscope has an ocular lens with a magnification of 10× and a “low” power objective lens with a magnification of 4×. A student places a ruler on the stage and observes that the field of view is 6.0 mm.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Calculate the total magnification.</li>
        <p class="Answer">10 × 4 = 40</p>

        <li>Calculate the image size.</li>
        <p class="Answer">40 × 6.0 mm = 240 mm = 24 cm</p>

        <li>The student increases the magnification by changing to a 20× “medium” power objective lens. Calculate the new magnification.</li>
        <p class="Answer">10 × 20 = 200</p>

        <li>Calculate the new field of view under medium power.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>240 mm / 200 = 1.2 mm</p>
            <p>Because the magnification is 5 times bigger compared to low power, the FoV is five times <em>smaller</em>!</p>
        </div>

        <li>Calculate the magnification and field of view under high magnification with an object lens magnification of 50.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Magnification = 10 × 50 = 500</p>
            <p>FoV = Image Size / Magnification = 240 mm / 500 = 0.48 mm</p>
        </div>

        <li>Students view a leaf under high magnification and observe that there are about 50 leaf “cells” across. How large is each leaf cell?</li>
        <p class="Answer">0.48 mm / 50 = 0.0096 mm</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identify the numbered parts of a <em class="Defn">compound light microscope</em>.
        <p class="Center"><img src="s10/bio1/img/micro.webp" alt="Microscope" data-aspect="318/329"/></p></li>
    <div class="Answer">
        1 = Revolving Nosepiece<br/>
        2 = Objective Lens<br/>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">magnification</em> and explain how to calculate the total magnification of a compound light microscope.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Magnification is the ratio of the size of the image we see compared to the actual size of the object we are looking at. The magnification of a compound light microscope is the product of the objective lens magnification and the ocular lens (eyepiece) magnification.</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Define <em class="Defn">field of view</em> and explain how it relates to the magnification and image size.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Field of view represents the total actual size of what we can see under the microscope. The image size is the product of the field of view and the total magnification.</p>

        <li>How can we measure the field of view under low magnification?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Under low magnification, you can observe the field of view directly by placing a transparent plastic ruler under the microscope.</p>

        <li>How can we calculate the field of view for medium and high magnification?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The field of view gets smaller when you increase the magnification, but the image size remains constant. This means you can calculate the image size under low magnification by multiplying the FoV by the magnification, and then divide that image size by the higher magnifications to get the FoV.</p>

        <li>How can we estimate the size of an object seen under a microscope?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Estimate how many of the object would need to be placed end-to-end equal the diameter of the image. Divide the FoV by this number to get the size of each such object.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Describe three other types of microscopes besides compound light microscopes.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Electron Microscope (Transmission or Scanning), Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, Scanning Tunnelling Microscope</p>
