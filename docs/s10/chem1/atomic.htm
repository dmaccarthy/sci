        <li>Complete this Bill Nye quote: “The atom is mostly...”</li>
        <div class="Answer">...empty space!</div>

        <li>What makes an <em class="Defn">atom</em> of one <em class="Defn">element</em> different from atoms of a different element (e.g. carbon vs. iron)?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The number of protons in the nucleus.</div>

        <li>What does <em class="Defn">atomic number</em> mean?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Atomic number identifies the number of protons in the nucleus. For example, the element carbon has an atomic number of 6, meaning all atoms with 6 protons are carbon atoms.</div>

        <li>What are the three types of particles that make up all atoms?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Protons, Neutrons, Electrons.</div>

        <li>State the relative charge and size of each of the three particles.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Electrons are tiny and negatively charged. Protons are positive and have a mass more than 1800 times larger than the electron. Neutrons have a mass (approximately) equal to the proton but are neutral (no electric charge).</div>

        <li>What is a <em class="Defn">nucleus</em>? Which particles would you find there?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The nucleus is the very dense (small but massive) centre of the atom that contains nearly all of its mass. It contains the protons and neutrons.</div>

        <li>Which particles are <em>not</em> found in the nucleus? Where would those particles be found?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The electrons orbit outside the nucleus. The electric attraction of the negative electrons to the positive protons creates the force that keeps the electrons in orbit, much like the Sun’s gravity keeps the planets in orbit around the Sun.</div>

    <h3>Atoms</h3>
    <p>Democritus (c. 400 BCE) proposed that if a pure substance were divided into smaller and smaller pieces,
        eventually we would arrive at something so small it could be divided no further.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The smallest piece of a pure substance is called an <em class="Defn">atom</em>.</li>
        <li>The word atom comes from the Greek word <span class="Blue">ἄτομον</span>, for <em>indivisible</em> or <em>uncuttable</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide">
    <h3>Billiard Ball Model</h3>
    <p>John Dalton (1808) proposed the first modern model of the atom.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atoms are the smallest (indivisible) particle of all matter.</li>
        <li>Atoms of the same element have the same size and mass.</li>
        <li>Different elements have atoms of different size and mass.</li>
        <li>In Dalton’s model, atoms have no internal parts; they are featureless spheres (like a <em class="Defn">billiard ball</em>).</li>
        <li>Compounds are created when atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
        <li>Dalton’s model explains why chemical reactions occur in definite proportions; running electricity through water creates hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.</li>
        <li>Dalton’s model also explains thermal properties of matter such as pressure and temperature.</li>
        <li>The Billiard Ball model does <em>not</em> explain the electrical properties of matter.</li>
        <li>Matter has positive and negative parts.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h3>Raisin Bun Model</h3>
    <p>J.J. Thomson performed experiments (1897) to see how positive and negative matter were affected by electric and magnetic forces. He concluded:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The negative parts of matter have much smaller mass than the positive parts.</li>
        <li>The mass of the positive parts depends on the element (same as Dalton’s model).</li>
        <li>The mass of the negative parts will always be the same, regardless of which element the negative part came from!</li>
        <li>These negative parts, common to all elements, are called <em class="Defn">electrons</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thomson (1904) proposed the <em class="Defn">Raisin Bun</em> or <em class="Defn">Plum Pudding</em> model.</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#bun"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The “bun” is a sphere containing most of the atom’s mass.</li>
        <li>Like the Billiard Ball model, the size and mass of the atom differ from one element to another.</li>
        <li>There are electrons (“raisins”) embedded in the atom (“bun”) that have a very small mass and a negative charge.</li>
        <li>Different elements have differing numbers of electrons, but the electrons all have the same properties regardless of which element they come from.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide">
    <h3>Planetary (Nuclear) Model</h3>
    <p>Ernest Rutherford and his students performed an experiment (1909) where they fired small, high-speed, positive particles at a thin gold foil. (Gold is a large atom.)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of these “alpha” particles passed through the gold foil with nearly no effect.</li>
        <li>A very small percentage of the alpha particles were deflected by the gold foil to very large angles.</li>
        <li>Rutherford concluded that the Raisin Bun model could not explain these results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rutherford proposed a new model called the <em>Planetary Model</em> (also called the “solar system” or “nuclear” model.)</p>
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#nuclear"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of the atom is empty space, since the alpha particles were unaffected.</li>
        <li>Most of the atom’s mass is concentrated in a tiny <em class="Defn">nucleus</em>, which causes some of the alpha particles to deflect.</li>
        <li>The electrons orbit around the nucleus like the planets orbiting the Sun.</li>
        <li>To account for measurements of atomic mass and charge, the nucleus must contain two kinds of particle...</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Protons have a positive charge.</li>
            <li>Neutrons have no charge.</li>
            <li>Protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The nucleus has a diameter of about 0.01 pm depending on the element. (A picometre is one-<em>trillionth</em> of a metre!)</li>
        <li>The electron orbits have diameters on the order of 100 pm, or about 10000 times the diameter of the nucleus.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Dalton’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What is the “nickname” of Dalton’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Billiard Ball” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Dalton’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another (e.g. carbon from hydrogen).</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center">
        <svg width="256" height="256" data-aspect="1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-128 -128 256 256">
            <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="127" style="fill: #F1B9A1; stroke: black"></circle>
        </svg>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atoms are uniform spheres (like a billiard ball!) with no parts.</li>
        <li>Atoms of the same element have the same mass and size.</li>
        <li>Atoms of different elements are different sizes; carbon atoms are larger than hydrogen atoms.</li>
        <li>Compounds are formed by atoms of different elements joining; a molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Dalton to propose this model. In other words, what observable facts can we understand by using Dalton’s model? </li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Some elements (e.g. oxygen and nitrogen) can form multiple compounds (e.g. NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
        <li>When water is decomposed, it will produce two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen.</li>
        <li>We can understand thermal concepts like temperature and pressure...</li>
        <li>Temperature measures the energy of the molecules while pressure measures the force they exert on their neighbours.</li>
        </ul></div>
</ol>

<h3>Thomson’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What are the nicknames of Thomson’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Raisin Bun” or “Plum Pudding” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Thomson’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#bun"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The mass of the atom is almost entirely positively charged (the “bun”).</li>
        <li>Tiny, negatively charged “electrons” are embedded throughout the atom (the “raisins”).</li>
        <li>Atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons as well as different sizes.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Thomson to propose this model to replace Dalton’s.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Dalton’s model could not explain the electrical properties of matter.</li>
        <li>Thomson’s experiments with cathode ray tubes showed that electric and magnetic forces cause <em>much</em> greater deflection of negative particles compared to positive particles at the same speed.</li>
        <li>Therefore, the negative particles must be much smaller!</li>
    </ul></div>
</ol>

<h3>Rutherford’s Model</h3>
<ol>
    <li>What are the nicknames of Rutherford’s atomic model?</li>
    <div class="Answer">“Planetary” or “Solar System” or “Nuclear” Model</div>

    <li>Draw an illustration of Rutherford’s model and describe its key features, including the parts of the atom (if any) and an explanation of what makes one element different from another.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
    <p class="Center"><svg class="s14" data-svg2="s10/chem1/img/atomic.js#nuclear"></svg></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The atom is mostly empty space!</li>
        <li>The positive charge and almost all the mass of the atom is in a tiny but massive “nucleus”.</li>
        <li>The negatively charged electrons orbit around the nucleus like planets around the Sun.</li>
        <li>The nucleus is made of protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge).</li>
    </ul></div>

    <li>Explain the evidence that caused Rutherford to propose this model to replace Thomson’s.</li>
    <div class="Answer"><ul>
        <li>Scattering experiments using alpha particles and thin metal (gold or aluminum) foils...</li>
        <li>Most alpha particles were undeflected, showing the atom is mostly empty.</li>
        <li>A small number of alpha particles were deflected by a very large angle, showing that something really massive and positive (the nucleus) repelled them.</li>
