<section class="Slide"><h3>Diffusion</h3>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Brownian motion</em> is the <em>random</em> motion of molecules that occurs in liquids and gases.</li>
    <li>The motion of molecules is faster at higher temperatures.</li>
    <li>Over time, Brownian motion causes the concentration of substances to become uniform.</li>
    <li>There is a net movement of material <em>down the concentration gradient</em> (from higher to lower concentrations).</li>
    <li>This effect is called <em class="Defn">diffusion</em>.</li>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Passive Transport</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Passive transport</em> means movement across a membrane that does not require any energy expenditure by the cell.</p>
<ol>
    <li><em class="Defn">Simple diffusion</em> is a type of passive transport that allows movement of small molecules (e.g. O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) that can fit between the phospholipid molecules that make up the membrane.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Osmosis</em> refers to the diffusion of <em>water</em>.</em></li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Facilitated diffusion</em> refers to diffusion of larger molecules (e.g. glucose) or ions that would be repelled by the phospholipids. This requires the help of <em class="Defn">transport proteins</em>.</li>
</ol>
<ul><li>Some molecules cannot pass through the membrane at all; biological membranes are <em class="Defn">semi-permeable</em>.</li></ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Osmosis</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Osmosis</em> is diffusion of water molecules through the membrane.</p>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Facilitated Diffusion</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Facilitated diffusion</em> is diffusions through <em class="Defn">transport proteins</em> embedded in the membrane.</p>

<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Channel proteins</em> allow diffusion of ions that cannot pass through the phospholipid molecules.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Carrier proteins</em> change shape to open to one side of the membrane at a time.</li>
    <li>Carrier proteins allow larger molecules like glucose to diffuse through the membrane.</li>
    <li>Carrier proteins can also allow molecules to be transported <em>against</em> the concentration gradient.</li>
    <li>This is called <em class="Defn">active transport</em> and, unlike passive transport, it requires energy.</li>

    <li>
        <p>A synthetic (non-biological) semi-permeable membrane is designed to permit the diffusion of molecules up to and including the size of glucose. Larger molecules like starch and proteins cannot pass through the membrane. On each diagram, draw and label arrows showing the direction of motion of all molecules (including water) that are able to pass through the membrane.</p>
        <p class="NoAnswer Center"><img src="s10/bio2/img/osmosis1.png"/></p>
    </li>
    <div class="Answer Center"><img src="s10/bio2/img/osmosis2.png"/></div>
    <li>A semipermeable membrane is used as a container. A solution containing 10% iodine (a small molecule) is poured inside the membrane. The membrane is sealed and is then inserted into a beaker containing 1% starch (a large molecule). When starch and iodine mix, a dark purple colour is produced.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>After a few minutes, will the solution inside the membrane turn purple? Will the solution outside the membrane turn purple? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Since starch is a large molecule, it is unable to pass through the membrane into the container so the interior will not turn purple. Iodine is a small molecule so it will diffuse out from the container into the surroundings which will turn purple because there is already starch there.</div>

        <li>Will the membrane shrink or expand? Explain.</li>
        <div class="Answer">The membrane is likely to expand as water enters the container through osmosis. This happens because there is a higher concentration of solute (lower concentration of water) inside compared to the “hypotonic” surroundings.</div>

    </ol></li>
    <li>Explain why diffusion across a membrane works for smaller molecules like H<sub>2</sub>0, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, but not for larger molecules like glucose.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Small molecules are able to diffuse through the spaces between the phospholipid molecules that make up the membrane. Larger molecules are too big to fit through these spaces.</p>
    <li>Explain the difference between <em class="Defn">active</em> and <em class="Defn">passive</em> transport across a membrane.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Passive transport relies on diffusion to move down the concentration gradient and requires no energy expenditure. Active transport uses energy, for example to move molecules up (against) the concentration gradient from lower to higher concentration.</p>
    <li>Explain how <em class="Defn">facilitated diffusion</em> works. Include a definition of transport proteins (carrier and channel) in your response.</li>
    <p class="Answer">For particles that cannot diffuse through the spaces between phospholipid molecules because they are too large or they have a charge the cause them to be repelled, diffusion can occur through transport proteins embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Channel proteins allow the passage of ions, while carrier proteins allow the passage of larger molecules, often by changing shape.</p>
