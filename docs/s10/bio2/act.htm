<section class="Slide"><h3>Active Transport</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Active transport</em> refers to the movement of materials through a membrane in a way that requires the cell to expend energy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Active transport often occurs when the cell needs to move materials against the concentration gradient.</li>
    <li>For example, plants roots need to absorb minerals even if the concentration in the soil is lower than the concentration already inside the cell.</li>
    <li>Carrier proteins can use active transport to move some molecules through the membrane.</li>
</ul>

</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Endocytosis</em> is a form of active transport where material enters the cell.</li>
    <li>The membrance forms a bulge in which the material settles.</li>
    <li>The bulge grows larger and the neck pinches together.</li>
    <li>The portion of the membrane enclosing the material separates from the cell membrane and becomes a new vesicle inside the cell.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Phagocytosis</em> refers to endocytosis where the material is solid.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Pinocytosis</em> refers to endocytosis where the material is liquid.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Exocytosis</em> is the reverse of endocytosis</li>
    <li>A vesicle containing waste or other material to be removed from the cell merges with the cell membrane and opens to expel the material.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Define and give examples of <em class="Defn">active transport</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Motion of substances across a membrane that requires energy. This happens when material needs to moved from lower to higher concentration. Passive transport (no energy needed) only works from high to low. Examples of active transport include endocytosis and exocytosis.</div>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">endocytosis</em> and draw an illustration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">This is when the membrane engulfs the material to be brought into the cell. The membrane “pit” pinches off to form a vesicle.</div>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">exocytosis</em> and draw an illustration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">This is the reverse of endocytosis, where a vesicle containing material to be moved outside the cell joins to the cell membrane and expels the material.</div>
