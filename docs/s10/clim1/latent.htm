<section class="Slide"><h3>Heat</h3>
    <p>Adding heat to a substance can cause...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles (temperature)</li>
        <li>an increase in the potential energy associated with the intermolecular bonds</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Phase Changes</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Caption">Heating Curve for 1 kg of Water</p>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Center"><svg class="s20" data-svg2="s10/clim1/img/latent.js#water"></svg></p>
    <p>When a <em class="Defn">phase change</em> occurs (e.g. solid to liquid) the heat goes <em>entirely</em> into potential energy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The temperature remains constant while the phase change is occuring.</li>
        <li>At 0.00 °C, ice begins to melt as more heat is added.</li>
        <li>The temperature remains at 0.00 °C until the water is completely liquid.</li>
        <li>Only after the ice is completely melted does the temperature begin to rise again.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Latent Heat</h3>
    <p>The amount of heat needed to cause a phase change is called the <em class="Defn">latent heat</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Latent heat of <em class="Defn">fusion</em> refers to a solid-to-liquid phase change.</li>
        <li>Latent heat of <em class="Defn">vapourization</em> refers to a liquid-to-gas phase change.</li>
        <li>Some substances change directly from solid to gas; this is called <em class="Defn">sublimation</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Water</h3>
    <p>The latent heat of fusion for water is:<p class="TeX">H_f = \rm{6.01\ kJ/mol}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This means that it takes 6010 joules of heat to completely melt one mole of ice.</li>
        <li>To convert between mass <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">m</span>)</span> and moles <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">n</span>)</span>, use the <em>molar mass</em> <span class="NoWrap">(<span class="TeX">M</span>)</span>:
        <p class="TeX">n = \frac{m}{M}</p></li>
        <li>If the amount of ice is more or less than one mole, we need to multiply by the number of moles:<p class="TeX">Q = nH</p></li>
        <li>The latent heat of <em>vapourization</em> for water is different than for fusion:<p class="TeX">H_v = \rm{40.65\ kJ/mol}</p></li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 1</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">How much heat does it take to melt 3.00 moles of ice?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="TeX">n = \rm{3.00\ mol}</span></li>
        <li><span class="TeX">H_f = 6.01\ \rm{kJ/mol}</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="TeX">Q = nH_f = \rm 3.00\ mol\cdot 6.01\ kJ/mol = 18.0 \ kJ</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 2</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">How much water can be converted to steam in one minute by a heater that produces 600 J/s?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="TeX">H_v = \rm 40.65\ kJ/mol = 4.065\times 10^4\ J/mol</span></li>
        <li><span class="TeX">Q = \rm 600\ J/s\cdot 60.0\ s = 3.60\times 10^4\ J</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="TeX">Q = nH_v</p>
    <p class="TeX">n = \frac{Q}{H_v} = \rm \frac{3.60\times 10^4\ J}{4.065\times 10^4\ J/mol} = 0.886\ mol</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3 class="Blue">Example 3</h3>
    <p data-cue="none" class="Blue">How much heat is needed to convert 100 grams of ice at 0.00 °C to water at 37.0 °C?</p>
    <p>We need to convert grams to moles to use the latent heat equation...</p>
    <p class="TeX">M = \rm{(2\times 1.01 + 16.00)\ g/mol = 18.02\ g/mol}</p>
    <p class="TeX">n = \frac{m}{M} = \rm{\frac{100\ g}{18.02\ g/mol} = 5.55\ mol}</p>
    <p class="TeX">Q = nH_f = \rm{5.55\ mol \cdot 6.01\ kJ/mol = 33.4\ kJ}</p>
    <p>This is the energy to melt the ice. The temperature is still 0.00 °C.</p>
    <p>To heat the water further...</p>
    <p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T = \rm 100\ g \cdot 4.19\ J/(g\cdot C) \cdot 37.0° C = 15.5\ kJ</p>
    <p>The total heat needed is 33.4 kJ + 15.5 kJ = 48.9 kJ</p>

    <li>Students in the Science Lab conduct a measurement where they heat a liquid to its boiling point and then measure how long it takes to completely turn to gas. A particular substance has a latent heat of vaporization <span class="TeX">H_v</span> = 8.50 kJ/mol, and it takes 3.00 minutes to vaporize when heated with 600 joules per second.

        <p class="TeX">Q = \rm{600\ J/s\cdot 180\ s = 108000\ J = 108\ kJ}</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>A student removes 75.0 grams of ice from a freezer that is kept at –18.0 °C. The student leaves the ice in a glass for several hours before it comes to equilibrium as liquid water at room temperature of 20.0 °C. How much heat did the ice/water absorb from the surroundings?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>First, the ice has to heat up to 0 °C before it can start melting...</p>
            <p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T = \rm{75.0\ g\cdot 2.00\ J/g\cdot °C\cdot 18.0 °C = 2700\ J= 2.70\ kJ}</p>
            <p></p>Next it needs to melt into liquid water...</p>
            <p class="TeX">n = \frac{m}{M} = \rm{\frac{75.0\ g}{18.02\ g/mol} = 4.16\ mol}</p>

        <li>The student now dumps the 75.0 grams of room temperature water into a kettle and heats it until it completely turns to steam at the boiling point of 100 °C. How much additional heat did the kettle add to the water?</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Heat the water from room pemperature to the boiling point...</p>
            <p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T = \rm{75.0\ g\cdot 4.19\ J/g\cdot °C\cdot 80.0 °C = 25140\ J = 25.1\ kJ}</p>
            <p>Convert the boiling water to steam...</p>
            <p class="TeX">Q = nH_v = \rm{4.16\ mol\cdot 40.65\ kJ/mol = 169.2\ kJ}</p>
            <p>The additional heat absorbed is...<p class="TeX">\rm{(25.1 + 169.2)\ kJ = 194\ kJ}</p>
        </div>

        <li>If the kettle produces 1000 joules of heat per second, how long did it take for the water to completely turn to steam?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Since the kettle produces 1 kilojoule of heat per second, it will take 194 seconds, or 3.24 minutes.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li>When water is thrown on a solid that has been heated to over 100 °C, the water will often vaporize as heat is transferred from the solid to the water. A 500-gram block of iron (<span class="TeX">c</span> = 0.449 J/g·°C) has been heated to 300 °C. How much water can the block vaporize? Assume that there is no loss of heat to the surroundings and that the initial temperature of the water and final temperatures of the iron and steam are all 100 °C.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>The heat lost by the cooling iron is...</p>
        <p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T = \rm{500\ g\cdot 0.449\ J/g\cdot °C\cdot (-200 °C) = -44900\ J}</p>
        <p>Since energy is conserved and no energy is lost to the surroundings, the water gains 44.9 kilojoules of thermal energy...</p>
        <p class="TeX">Q = nH_v</p>
        <p class="TeX">n = \frac{Q}{H_v} = \rm{\frac{44.9\ kJ}{40.65\ kJ/mol} = 1.10\ mol}</p>
        <p class="TeX">m = nM = \rm{1.10\ mol\cdot 18.02\ g/mol = 19.9\ g}</p>

        <li>Define <em class="Defn">phase change</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">A phase change is when a material changes from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas when heat is added; or when heat is removed and the change occurs in the reverse direction.</p>

        <li>Explain why the temperature of a substance does not change even though heat is being added during a phase change.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Temperature is a measure of kinetic energy. During a phase change, the heat added increases the potential energy associated with the intermolecular forces.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li>Explain what “latent heat of fusion” and “latent heat of vaporization” mean.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Latent heat of fusion means the amount of heat energy required to make one mole of substance at its melting point turn from solid to liquid.</p>
        <p>Latent heat of vaporization means the amount of heat energy required to make one mole of substance at its boiling point turn from liquid to gas.</p>
    </div>

    <li>State and explain the formula for calculating the heat (energy) needed to cause a phase change.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p class="TeX">Q=nH</p>
        <p>The latent heat (<span class="TeX">H</span>) is the amount of heat needed for one mole of a substance to undergo the phase change. This varies depending on the substance.</p>
        <p>The total amount of heat added (<span class="TeX">Q</span>) during a phase transition is equal to the latent heat multiplied by the number of moles of substance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <li>Explain what a “heating curve” is and how to interpret the horizontal and sloped sections of the graph.</li>
    <p class="Answer">This is a graph showing how temperature changes as more heat is added. The horizontal sections, where heat is being added but the temperature is not changing, correspond to phase changes. The lengths of the horizontal segments are proportional to the latent heat. The sloped sections represent rising temperature for one specific phase. The slope of each segment is inversely proportional to the specific heat capacity; steeper lines correspond to lower heat capacities.</p>
