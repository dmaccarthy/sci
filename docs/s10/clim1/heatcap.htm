<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy &amp; Temperature</h3>
<p>We learned about <a data-feed="s10/phys2/heat">Kinetic-Molecular Theory</a> in the Physics unit.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Temperature</em> measures the <em>average</em> kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.</li>
    <li>We can increase the temperature of an object by adding energy (heat).</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Thermal energy</em> is the <em>total</em> kinetic energy all the particles in a substance.</li>
    <li>A larger quantity of a substance will require more energy to heat.</li>
    <li>For example, heating 200 grams of water from 20° to 30° C will require twice as much heat energy as heating 100 grams of water by the same temperature.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Heat Capacity</h3>
<p>The ratio of heat added (<span class="TeX">Q</span>) to the resulting change in temperature (<span class="TeX">\Delta T</span>) is called the <em class="Defn">heat capacity</em>:</p>
<p class="TeX">{Q \over \Delta T} = mc</p>
<ul>
    <li>The variable <span class="TeX">c</span> is called the <em class="Defn">specific heat capacity</em>.</li>
    <li>Specific heat capacity is the heat capacity of 1 gram of substance; the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram by 1° C.</li>
    <li>This equation can be rearranged as:</li>
</ul>
<p data-cue="prev" class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 1</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">Students perform an experiment where they use an electric heater to heat 100 grams of liquid water inside an insulated container.
    The water temperature increases from 20.0° to 30.0° C as 4186 joules of heat is added. What is the specific heat capacity of water?</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="TeX">m = \mathrm{100\ g}</span></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">\Delta T = \mathrm{30.0°\ C - 20.0°\ C = 10.0°\ C}</span></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">Q = \mathrm{4186\ J}</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T</p>
<p class="TeX">{Q \over m\Delta T} = c</p>
<p class="TeX">= \mathrm{{4186\ J \over 100\ g\cdot 10.0°\ C} = 4.19\ {J\over g\cdot °\ C}}</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Liquid Water...</h3>
<p>Liquid water has a specific heat capacity of 4.19 J/g·°C.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This means it takes 4.19 joules of heat energy to increase the temperatue of each gram of water by 1 °C.</li>
    <li>100 grams of water would need 100 times as much heat; the heat capacity would be 419 J/°C.</li>
    <li>Heating the water by 10 °C would require 10 times more energy: 4190 J.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Specific Heat Capacity</h3>
<p>Different substances have different specific heat capacities.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For example, copper has <span class="TeX">c = \mathrm{0.385\ J/g\cdot °C}</span>, which is more than 10 times less than liquid water.</li>
    <li>If <em>all</em> of the heat added went towards increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules, all substances would have the same specific heat capacity.</li>
    <li>Intermolecular bonds (such as hydrogen bonds) represent a type of potential energy...</li>
    <li>When the particles move faster, they move apart and “stretch” those bonds, increasing the potential energy.</li>
    <li>Substances with strong hydrogen bonds (like water) require a lot more energy to heat; they have a much bigger specific heat capacity.</li>
    <li>Intermolecular bonds are much different is solids, liquids, and gases. The specific heat capacity is different for different phases of matter.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Example 2</h3>
<p data-cue="none" class="Blue">A 120 gram block of copper is initially at room temperature of 20.0 °C. An electric heater is used to add 5.00 kilojoules of heat to the copper. Find its final temperature.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="TeX">m = \mathrm{120\ g}</span></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">T_i = \mathrm{20.0\ °C}</span></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">c = \mathrm{0.385\ J/g\cdot °C}</span></li>
    <li><span class="TeX">Q = \mathrm{5000\ J}</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="TeX">Q = mc\Delta T</p>
<p class="TeX">{Q \over mc} = \Delta T</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta T = \mathrm{\frac{5000\ J}{120\ g\cdot 0.385\ J/g\cdot °C} = 108\ °C}</p>
<p>Note that this is the <em>change in</em> the temperature. We still have to find the <em>final</em> temperature...</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta T = T_f-T_i</p>
<p class="TeX">\Delta T + T_i = T_f-T_i + T_i</p>
<p class="TeX">T_f = \Delta T + T_i = \mathrm{(108 + 20.0)\ °C = 128\ °C}</p>
