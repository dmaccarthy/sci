<h1 id="Title">Energy Budget &amp; Greenhouse Effect</h1>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Systems</h3>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">open system</em> is one that allows <em>both</em> energy and matter into and out of the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A mug of hot chocolate would be classified as an open system.</li>
        <li>You can add energy by microwaving it.</li>
        <li>You can remove energy by allowing it to transfer heat into the air.</li>
        <li>You can add matter by adding marshmallows or more water.</li>
        <li>You can remove matter by drinking some.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">closed system</em> is one that allows <em>energy</em> into and out of the system but <em>not</em> matter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth is very close to being a closed system.</li>
        <li>Radiation from the Sun adds energy.</li>
        <li>Earth emits its own radiation which removes energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">isolated system</em> allows <em>neither</em> energy nor mass to enter or leave the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The only truly isolated system is the universe in its entirety.</li>
        <li>Scientists sometimes use the concept of an isolated as an idealization.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Biosphere</h3>
    <p>Life on Earth exists in the <em class="Defn">biosphere</em>.</p>
    <p>The biosphere has three parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atmosphere: air.</li>
        <li>Hydrosphere: water.</li>
        <li>Lithosphere: land.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Weather &amp; Climate</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Weather</em> means atmospheric conditions such as temperature,
        precipitation, air pressure, humidity, and wind.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather happens at a specific place and time.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><em class="Defn">Climate</em> refers to the <em>average</em> weather patterns over many years.</p>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Energy Budget</h3>
    <p>For Earth’s climate system, the heat added is almost exclusively radiation (light, UV, IR) from the Sun.</p>
    <p>The heat lost is almost exclusively radiation from Earth into space.</p>
    <p>Earth’s <em class="Defn">radiation budget</em> is an accounting of where the incoming energy goes, and where the outgoing radiation comes from...</p>

</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Albedo</h3>
    <p>Some of the incoming radiation from the Sun gets reflected by the atmosphere or the ground.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy that is reflected never gets absorbed by the Earth.</li>
        <li>The prercentage of energy reflected is called the Earth’s <em class="Defn">albedo</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Greenhouse Effect</h3>
    <p>The Sun (5800 K) is nealy 20 times hotter than the Earth (300 K).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This means that the radiation emitted by Earth is very different from radiation emitted by the Sun.</li>
        <li>The Sun emits mostly visible light, with some infrared and ultraviolet radiation.</li>
        <li>Earth emits only “far infrared” radiation that has a wavelength about 20 times longer than visible light.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Earth’s atmosphere contains CO<sub>2</sub>, water, methane, and other <em class="Defn">greenhouse gases</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These gases allow sunlight to pass through, but absorb infrared radiation from the ground.</li>
        <li>When the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere changes, it will affect the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.</li>
        <li>More greehouse gases means less infrared radiation can escape the Earth; but the incoming energy will not be affected.</li>
        <li>This would cause a rise in average temperature.</li>
        <li>Earth would be much colder if there were no greenhouse gases.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Feedbacks</h3>
    <p>One of the difficulties with modeling climate change is feebacks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <em class="Defn">feedback</em> is a change that becomes the <em>cause</em> of <em>additional</em> changes.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Positive</em> feedbacks cause subsequent changes that are in the <em>same</em> direction as the initial change.</li>
        <li>One example is when increased temperature reduces the size of glaciers / ice caps causing the Earth to reflect less sunlight, resulting in further temperature increase.</li>
        <li>Another positive feedback is when warming causes permafrost to melt and release additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><em class="Defn">Negative</em> feedbacks cause subsequent changes that are in the <em>opposite</em> direction as the initial change.</li>
        <li>For example as temperature increases, Earth emits more infrared radiation resulting in <em>less</em> heating.</li>
        <li>Positive and negative do <b>not</b> mean “good” and “bad”.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Post" data-answers="1" data-icon="correct">
<h2 class="Collapse">Review</h2><div class="Collapse">
<ol>
    <li>Define <em class="Defn">open</em>, <em class="Defn">closed</em> and <em class="Defn">isolated</em> systems. Which type of system is Earth?</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Open = Matter and energy can both leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Closed = Energy (but not matter) can leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Isolated = Neither energy nor matter can leave or enter the system.</p>
        <p>Earth is <em>nearly</em> a closed system; a very small amount of matter enters or leaves.</p>
    </div>

    <li>What does <em class="Defn">biosphere</em> mean? What are the three parts of Earth’s biosphere?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Biosphere is the part of Earth where life is found: Atmosphere (air), Hydrosphere (water) and Lithosphere (land).</p>

    <li>Why and how is the incoming radiation that Earth receives from the Sun different from the outgoing radiation that Earth sends into space?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The Sun is about 20 times hotter than the Earth, so it emits mostly visible, ultraviolet, and some infrared radiation. Earth emits almost entirely IR.</p>

    <li>What do we mean by Earth’s <em class="Defn">radiation budget</em>? According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, what must happen if the incoming and outgoing radiation do not balance?</li>
    <p class="Answer">This refers to the balance among incoming, reflected, absorbed, and emitted radiation by Earth. According to the Laws of THermodynamics, if there is a difference between the total incoming and outgoing energy, the average temerature of the climate system must change.</p>

    <li>Define and explain what <em class="Defn">albedo</em> means.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Albedo is the percentage of the incoming radiation from the Sun that is reflected without being absorbed.</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Describe the <em class="Defn">greenhouse effect</em>.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Incoming radiation in the Sun is primarily visible light which passes through the atmosphere easily.
            Outgoing radiation from Earth is infrared, much of which is absorbed by CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases in the atmosphere.
            Since these greenhouse gases affect outgoing but not incoming radiation, they alter the energy budget balance.
        </p>

        <li>How would Earth’s climate be different if there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?</li>
        <p class="Answer">It would be much colder as more infrared radiation would carry energy away from the Earth.</p>
    </ol></li>
