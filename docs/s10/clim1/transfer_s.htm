<section id="dQ" class="Slide"><h3>Heat Transfer</h3>
    <p>Heat flows from higher to lower temperatures. There are three main mechanisms of heat transfer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduction</li>
        <li>Convection</li>
        <li>Radiation</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="cond" class="Slide"><h3>Conduction</h3>
    <p>According to Kinetic-Molecular Theory, temperature measures the average kinetic energy of the particles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When two objects at different temperatures are <em>in contact</em> with each other, the particles will collide with each other.</li>
        <li>On average, the higher energy (hotter) particles lose energy and the lower energy (colder) particles gain energy.</li>
        <li>There is a flow of heat from hot to cold.</li>
        <li>This mechanism of heat transfer is called <em class="Defn">conduction</em>.</li>
        <li>Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases.</li>
        <li>Some materials, like most metals, are better conductors of heat.</li>
        <li>Insulators, like styrofoam and fibreglass, are poor conductors of heat.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="conv" class="Slide"><h3>Convection</h3>
    <p>In fluids (liquids and gases), heat can be transported via <em class="Defn">convection</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most fluids expand (become less dense) when heated.</li>
        <li>Hotter regions will be more buoyant and will rise.</li>
        <li>Colder parts of the fluid will be drawn in to replace the rising hotter fluid.</li>
        <li>The net result of this effect will be a <em class="Defn">convection current</em>.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="rad" class="Slide"><h3>Radiation</h3>
    <p>Objects that are really hot emit light and other forms of <em class="Defn">electromagnetic radiation</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Since light is a form of energy, radiation results in a decrease of temperature.</li>
        <li>When the light strikes another object, that object gains energy.</li>
        <li>At the temperature of the Sun (5800 K), objects radiate all colours of the rainbow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Center"><img class="w16" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Rainbow_30737_20130815160755.JPG/800px-Rainbow_30737_20130815160755.JPG"/></p>
    <ul>
        <li>At even hotter temperatures, there is more radiation produced at the violet end of the spectrum and into the untraviolet.</li>
        <li>At lower temperatures, less violet light is produced and the light appears orange or red.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Room temperature objects emit <em class="Defn">infrared radiation</em>; radiation like light but with a wavelength to long to be visible.</li>
        <!-- <li>.</li> -->
    </ul>

<section id="clim" class="Slide"><h3>Heat &amp; Climate</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Convection currents in the atmosphere and the oceans play an important role in distributing heat around the Earth.</p>
        <li>Radiation received from the Sun adds heat to the Earth’s climate system.</li>
        <li>Radiation emitted by the Earth removes heat to the Earth’s climate system.</li>
    </ul>
