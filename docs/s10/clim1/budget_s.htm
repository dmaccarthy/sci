<section id="sys" class="Slide"><h3>Systems</h3>
    <p>An <em class="Defn">open system</em> is one that allows both energy and matter into and out of the system.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A mug of hot chocolate would be classified as an open system.</li>
        <li>You can add energy by microwaving it.</li>
        <li>You can remove energy by allowing it to transfer heat into the air.</li>
        <li>You can add matter by adding marshmallows or more water.</li>
        <li>You can remove matter by drinking some.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <em class="Defn">closed system</em> is one that allows both energy into and out of the system but not matter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth is very close to being a closed system.</li>
        <li>Radiation from the Sun adds energy.</li>
        <li>Earth emits its own radiation which removes energy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="10">An <em class="Defn">isolated system</em> allows neither energy nor mass to enter or leave the system.</p>
    <ul data-cue="11">
        <li>The only truly isolated system is the universe in its entirety.</li>
        <li data-cue="12">Scientists sometimes use the concept of an isolated as an idealization.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="bio" class="Slide"><h3>Biosphere</h3>
    <p>Life on Earth exists in the <em class="Defn">biosphere</em>.</p>
    <p>The biosphere has three parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atmosphere: air.</li>
        <li>Hydrosphere: water.</li>
        <li>Lithosphere: land.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="weather" class="Slide"><h3>Weather &amp; Climate</h3>
    <p><em class="Defn">Weather</em> means atmospheric conditions such as temperature,
        precipitation, air pressure, humidity, and wind.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather happens at a specific place and time.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><em class="Defn">Climate</em> refers to the <em>average</em> weather patterns over many years.</p>
</section>

<section id="clim" class="Slide"><h3>Earth Climate</h3>
    <p>For Earth’s climate system, the heat added is almost exclusively radiation (light, UV, IR) from Sun.</p>
    <p>The heat lost is almost exclusively radiation from Earth into space.</p>
    <p>Earth’s <em class="Defn">radiation budget</em> is an accounting of where the incoming energy goes, and where the outgoing radiation comes from...</p>

<section id="alb" class="Slide"><h3>Albedo</h3>
    <p>Some of the incoming radiation from the Sun gets reflected by the atmosphere or the ground.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy that is reflected never gets absorbed by the Earth.</li>
        <li>The prercentage of energy reflected is called the Earth’s <em class="Defn">albedo</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="ghe" class="Slide"><h3>Greenhouse Effect</h3>
    <p>The Sun (5800 K) is nealy 20 times hotter than the Earth (300 K).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This means that the radiation emitted by Earth is very different from radiation emitted by the Sun.</li>
        <li>The Sun emits mostly visible light, with some infrared and ultraviolet radiation.</li>
        <li>Earth emits only “far infrared” radiation that has a wavelength about 20 times longer than visible light.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Earth’s atmosphere contains CO<sub>2</sub>, water, methane, and other <em class="Defn">greenhouse gases</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These gases allow sunlight to pass through, but absorb infrared radiation from the ground.</li>
        <li>When the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere changes, it will affect the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation.</li>
        <li>More greehouse gases means less infrared radiation can escape the Earth; but the incoming energy will not be affected.</li>
        <li>This would cause a rise in average temperature.</li>
        <li>As Earth’s temperature increases, it would emit more radiation until it again balances the incoming radiation at a higher equilibrium temperature.</li>
        <li data-cue="10">Earth would be much colder if there were no greenhouse gases.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="fb" class="Slide"><h3>Feedbacks</h3>
    <p>One of the difficulties with modeling climate change is <em class-"Defn">feedbacks</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, if warming reduces the size of glaciers / ice caps, the Earth’s albedo will change.</li>
        <li>If less incoming sunlight gets reflected, there will be more heating.</li>
        <li>Melting permafrost can release additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
