    <p>The <em class="Defn">manipulated</em> variable is the one that is intentionally changed during an experiment.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">The <em class="Defn">responding</em> variable is the one that is hypothesized (predicted) to change when the manipulated variable changes.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Other variables must be <em class="Defn">controlled</em> (kept constant) over the course of the experiment.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Once the data collection is finished, we will usually need to make a graph to see if there is a relationship between the manipulated and responding variables.</p>

        <li>What is a scatter plot and when do we use it?</li>
        <div class="Answer">A graph that shows how the manipulated and responding variables are related when both are numerical measurements.</div>
    
        <li>Why must scatter plots be drawn and graph paper, and why is it best to use as much of the available space as possible?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Graph paper helps make the graph more precise. Larger graphs can be read more precisely too.</div>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Which variable goes on which axis for a scatter plot?</li>

        <li>Summarize the key features in properly labelling each axis.</li>
        <div class="Answer"><ul>
            <li>Include the name, symbol, and units for the variable.</li>
            <li>Number the squares at a fixed interval (e.g. every second square).</li>
            <li>Numbering of squares must increase by a fixed amount (e.g. 0, 5, 10, 15, 20...)</li>
            <li>If you do not start numbering at 0, start at a number that is a multiple of what you are counting by.</li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>State two reasons for adding a best-fit line to a scatter plot?</li>
        <div class="Answer">To illustrate the trend of the data, make predications about the data, and see how scattered the data is.</div>

        <li>When would you not want to add a best-fit line?	</li>
        <div class="Answer">When the data has an obvious curve.</div>

        <li>Describe how to draw an appropriate best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Place your ruler on the <em>mean</em> (average) of both variables and rotate the ruler so that the average distance to the data points is as small as possible.</div>

        <li>Define interpolation and extrapolation.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Interpolation means using the best-fit line to make predictions within the range of data. Extrapolation is when we make predictions that go beyond the range of the data.</div>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Summarize how to calculate the slope of a best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">Identify two points from opposite ends of the best-fit line, and record the coordinates of both lines. Calculate the rise (difference in <span class="TeX">y</span>-values) and run (difference in <span class="TeX">x</span>-values) and divide to get the slope:
            <p class="TeX">k = {\rm\frac{Rise}{Run}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =\rm{\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}</p>
        </div>

        <li>How do you determine the units of the slope?</li>
        <div class="Answer">The units of the <span class="TeX">y</span>-axis divided by the units of the <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis.</div>
        
        <li>What is the significance of the slope? In other words, what does the slope tell us about the data?</li>
        <div class="Answer">Slope tells the ratio of how the variables change; how much the responding variable changes for each unit change in the manipulated variable.</div>
