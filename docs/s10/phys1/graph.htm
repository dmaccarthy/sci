<section class="Slide"><h3>Experimental Variables</h3>
    <p>The <em class="Defn">manipulated</em> variable is the one that is intentionally changed during an experiment.</p>
    <p>The <em class="Defn">responding</em> variable is the one that is hypothesized (predicted) to change when the manipulated variable changes.</p>
    <p>Other variables must be <em class="Defn">controlled</em> (kept constant) over the course of the experiment.</p>
    <p>Once the data collection is finished, we will usually need to make a graph to see if there is a relationship between the manipulated and responding variables.</p>

    <li>Graphs must be drawn on graph paper and should be large; use all available space.</li>
    <li>Graphs must have a descriptive title. The subtitle should identify the variables being plotted in the form “responding vs. manipulated.”</li>
    <li>Each axis must be labelled with the variable name and/or symbol, and units.</li>
    <li>The manipulated variable must be graphed on the horizontal (<i>x</i>) axis and the responding variable on the vertical (<i>y</i>) axis.</li>
    <li>Label the axes so that all data points fit on the graph, using as much space as possible.</li>
    <li>The “tick marks” on each axis must be evenly spaced.</li>
    <li>Tick marks must be numbered using a common interval and must start either at zero or a multiple of the interval used.</li>
    <li>For example, if you are counting by 3’s on your <i>x</i>-axis, your first labelled tick mark must be 0 or a multiple of 3.</li>
    <li>Data points must be drawn accurately and must not be connected.</li>
    <li>Only if the data shows a linear trend, you should add a best-fit line.</li>
    <li>A good best-fit line illustrates the trend of the data with equal numbers of data points above and below the line. The average distance between the data points and the best-fit line should be minimized.</li>

        <li>Based on how the data is presented, which variable is being treated as the manipulated variable and which is being treated as the responding variable?</li>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the height of a “typical” tree of this species in this location that has a circumference of 2.00 metres. Explain how you made your prediction.</li>
        <p class="Answer">About 9.6 metres. Find 2.0 metres of the <i>Circumference</i> axis and read the <i>Height</i> from the graph where the best-fit line passes.</p>

        <li>Using your best-fit line, predict the circumference of a “typical” tree of this species in this location that has a height of 20.0 metres. Explain how you made your prediction.</li>
        <p class="Answer">About 8.8 metres. Find 20.0 metres of the <i>Height</i> axis and read the <i>Circumference</i> from the graph where the best-fit line passes.</p>

        <li>For (c) and (d), which prediction would you be more confident of? Why?</li>
        <p class="Answer">For (c) we are interpolating, which is more reliable than extrapolating as in (d).</p>

        <li>Calculate the slope of the best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Using the points (0.00 m, 102.7 kPa) and (1.00 m, 112.5 kPa) the slope is:</p>
            <p class="TeX">k = \rm{\frac{(112.5-102.7)\ kPa}{(1.00 - 0.00)\ m} = 9.80\ kPa/m}</p>
        </div>

        <li>What is the significance of the slope?</li>
        <p class="Answer">A slope of 9.80 kPa/m means that the pressure increases by 9.80 kilopascals for every increase in depth of 1.0 metre.</p>

        <li>What is the pressure in the air directly above the surface of the pool?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Based on the best-fit line, at a depth of zero, the pressure is 102.7 kPa.</p>

        <li><p>According to fluid mechanics, the slope (in standard units!) should equal the strength of Earth's gravity (<span class="TeX">g</span>) multiplied by the density (<span class="TeX">\rho</span>) of pool water:</p>
        <p class="TeX">k = g\rho</p>
        <p>Tap water has a density of about 998 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Use your slope to calculate <span class="TeX">g</span>.</p></li>
        <p class="TeX Answer">g = \frac{k}{\rho} = \rm \frac{9800\ Pa/m}{998\ kg/m^3} = 9.82\ Pa\cdot m^2/kg</p>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>What is a scatter plot and when do we use it?</li>
        <p class="Answer">A graph that shows how the manipulated and responding variables are related when both are numerical measurements.</p>
    
        <li>Why must scatter plots be drawn and graph paper, and why is it best to use as much of the available space as possible?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Graph paper helps make the graph more precise. Larger graphs can be read more precisely too.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Which variable goes on which axis for a scatter plot?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Manipulated variable goes on the horizontal (bottom) axis and responding goes on the vertical (side).</p>

        <li>Summarize the key features in properly labelling each axis.</li>
        <ul class="Answer">
            <li>Include the name, symbol, and units for the variable.</li>
            <li>Number the squares at a fixed interval (e.g. every second square).</li>
            <li>Numbering of squares must increase by a fixed amount (e.g. 0, 5, 10, 15, 20...)</li>
            <li>If you do not start numbering at 0, start at a number that is a multiple of what you are counting by.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>State two reasons for adding a best-fit line to a scatter plot?</li>
        <p class="Answer">To illustrate the trend of the data, make predications about the data, and see how scattered the data is.</p>

        <li>When would you not want to add a best-fit line?	</li>
        <p class="Answer">When the data has an obvious curve.</p>

        <li>Describe how to draw an appropriate best-fit line.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Place your ruler on the <em>mean</em> (average) of both variables and rotate the ruler so that the average distance to the data points is as small as possible.</p>

        <li>Define interpolation and extrapolation.</li>
        <p class="Answer">Interpolation means using the best-fit line to make predictions within the range of data. Extrapolation is when we make predictions that go beyond the range of the data.</p>
    </ol></li>

    <li><ol type="a">
        <li>Summarize how to calculate the slope of a best-fit line.</li>
        <div class="Answer">
            <p>Identify two points from opposite ends of the best-fit line, and record the coordinates of both lines. Calculate the rise (difference in <span class="TeX">y</span>-values) and run (difference in <span class="TeX">x</span>-values) and divide to get the slope:</p>
            <p class="TeX">k = {\rm\frac{Rise}{Run}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =\rm{\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}</p>
        </div>

        <li>How do you determine the units of the slope?</li>
        <p class="Answer">The units of the <span class="TeX">y</span>-axis divided by the units of the <span class="TeX">x</span>-axis.</p>
        
        <li>What is the significance of the slope? In other words, what does the slope tell us about the data?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Slope tells the ratio of how the variables change; how much the responding variable changes for each unit change in the manipulated variable.</p>
