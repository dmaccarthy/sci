<section class="Slide"><h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>The branch of Physics that studies <em>motion</em> is called <em class="Defn">mechanics</em>.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">The main sub-branches of mechanics are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Kinematics</em>: <em>Describes</em> the motion of an object.</li>
        <li data-cue="+"><em class="Defn">Dynamics</em>: <em>Explains</em> the motion of an object.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Position</h3>
    <p class="Center"><svg data-js="p20/kin/img/displ#bike" class="w36"></svg></p>
    <p>The first step in describing an object’s motion is to describe its <em class="Defn">position</em>; where is it?</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Typically, we start by choosing a convenient location as the <em class="Defn">origin</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="+">The origin is assigned a <em class="Defn">coordinate</em> of zero.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The choice of origin is completely arbitrary.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Points along the <em class="Defn">coordinate axis</em> are represented by the distance from the origin.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Positive coordinates are used in one direction and negative coordinates in the other.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">For motion in a straight line, only one coordinate axis is needed. This is called one dimensional (1D) motion.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Motion on a sports field would be two dimensional (2D) motion because it requires two coordinate axis.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Displacement</h3>
    <p class="Center Present"><svg data-js="p20/kin/img/displ#bike" class="w36"></svg></p>
    <p>A moving object will have a position that is <em>changing</em> over time.</p>
    <div data-cue="+">
        <p>The change in an object’s position between two times is called its <em class="Defn">displacement</em>:</p>
        <p><p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \vec{\bf d}_f - \vec{\bf d}_i</p></p>    
    </div>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>The subscripts <span class="TeX">i</span> and <span class="TeX">f</span> stand for <em>initial</em> and <em>final</em>.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">The symbol <span class="TeX">\Delta</span> is the Greek letter “Delta”, which stands for <em>difference</em> (change).</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+" class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{(+7.0\ m) - (-5.0\ m) = +12.0\ m}</p>
    <p data-cue="+">The bike undergoes a displacement of <span class="TeX">\rm{+12.0\ m}</span> as it moves from an initial position of <span class="TeX">\rm{-5.0\ m}</span> to a final position of <span class="TeX">\rm{+7.0\ m}</span>.</p>
    <p data-cue="+">Displacement is illustrated on a <em class="Defn">vector diagram</em> by an <em>arrow</em> pointing from the object’s initial position to its final position.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Saying <span class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{+12.0\ m}</span> means that the arrow points in the positive direction and is 12.0 metres long.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Vectors &amp; Scalars</h3>
    <p>Quantities that involve a <em class="Defn">direction</em>, such as displacement, are called <em class="Defn">vectors</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="+">When we say the displacement is <span class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \rm{+12.0\ m}</span>, this means that the <em class="Defn">magnitude</em> (size) of the vector is 12.0 metres and the direction is positive.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Other vectors include velocity (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf v}</span>) and force (<span class="TeX">\vec{\bf F}</span>).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Vector variables are written with an arrow above the symbol, or printed in bold type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-cue="+">Quantities that do not involve a direction are called <em class="Defn">scalars</em>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-cue="+">Scalars include time (<span class="TeX">t</span>), mass (<span class="TeX">m</span>), and energy (<span class="TeX">E</span>).</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Scalar variables are written without an arrow, or printed in italics.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Distance</h3>
    <p >The <em class="Defn">distance</em> that an object moves is a scalar; it does not involve a direction.</p>
    <ul data-cue="+">
        <li>Distance is measured along the path (or <em class="Defn">trajectory</em>) that the object actually follows.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">Displacement is measured in a straight line between the initial and final positions, regardless of the object’s trajectory.</li>
        <li data-cue="+">If the object follows an indirect route, its distance will be more than the magnitude of its displacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">scalar</em> and a <em class="Defn">vector</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">A vector is a quantity that involves a direction, such as velocity or force. A scalar is a quantity that does not have a direction, such as time or mass.</div>

    <li>How do we measure an object’s <em class="Defn">position</em> in physics? In your answer, include definitions for the terms: <em class="Defn">origin</em> and <em class="Defn">coordinate</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">A coordinate is a measurement that represents an object’s position or location. It is often just a distance from an arbitrary point called the origin. The origin itself has a coordinate of zero. Positions on one side of the origin are assigned positive coordinates and the other side is assigned negative coordinates.</div>

    <li>Define and give the formula for <em class="Defn">displacement</em>.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Displacement (<span class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d}</span>) is the difference or change in an object’s position at two different times.
        <p class="TeX">\Delta\vec{\bf d} = \vec{\bf d}_f - \vec{\bf d}_i</p>
        The symbol <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}_i</span> is the <em>initial</em> position and <span class="TeX">\vec{\bf d}_f</span> is the <em>final</em> position.
    </div>

    <li>Explain how displacement and <em class="Defn">distance</em> are different.</li>
    <div class="Answer">Distance is a scalar that measures how far an object has travelled along its trajectory (path). Displacement is a vector that compares where the object ends up to where it starts. Displacement is always measured along the most direct path (a straight line) even if the object does not follow a straight trajectory.</div>
