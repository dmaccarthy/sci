<section class="Slide"><h3>Gas Exchange</h3>
<p>Gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O) are important for photosynthesis and cellular respiration.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cellular respiration uses O<sub>2</sub> and makes CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
    <li>Photosynthesis uses CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and produces O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>Plants consume more CO<sub>2</sub> than they produce.</li>
    <li>Animals exchange gases using lungs and blood.</li>
    <li>Plants exchange gases by <em>passive transport</em> as the <em>stomata</em> allow gases to <em>diffuse</em> in and out.</li>
    <li>CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into the leaf through the stomata.</li>
    <li>It then diffuses into the spongy mesophyll and palisade tissue where it is used for photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>The concentration gradient is created by photosynthesis which consumes CO<sub>2</sub> inside the leaf, resulting in a lower concentration than in the air outside.</li>
    <li>Photosynthesis produces oxygen, resulting in a <em>higher</em> concentration inside the leaf.</li>
    <li>O<sub>2</sub> diffuses out of the leaf through the stomata.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Lenticels</h3>
<p>Woody plants such as trees with bark have special openings called lenticels which allow for gas exchange.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lenticels appear as white spots.

<section class="Slide"><h3>Transpiration</h3>
<p>Transpiration is the evaporation of water from leaves.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plants can lose up to 99% of the water taken up by the roots by transpiration.</li>
    <li>An average maple tree can lose 200 L of water per hour due to transpiration in summer.</li>
    <li>Just as animals sweat to keep cool, transpiration carries away heat energy and can cool the leaf by 10° C to prevent heat damage.</li>
    <li>Transpiration occurs via diffusion through the stomata, just as with CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
    <li>When conditions are dry, the guard cells shrivel (plasmolysis), causing the stomata to close, and preventing more water loss.
        <p class="Center"><a title="Click for source" target="Wiki2" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tomato_stoma_observed_through_immersion_oil.gif"><img class="s12" alt="Stoma" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Tomato_stoma_observed_through_immersion_oil.gif"/></a></p>
    </li>
    <li>In wetter conditions, ncreased turgor pressure expands the guard cells, causing the stomata to open, and allowing more transpiration.</li>
</ul>

        <li>What are the <em class="Defn">stomata</em>? Where are they found? What is their function?</li>
        <p class="Answer">Openings in the bottom of the leaf that allow gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, water) in and out.</p>

        <li>Draw a labelled illustration of a stoma with its guard cells.</li>
        <p class="Answer Center"><a target="Wiki3" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Opening_and_Closing_of_Stoma.svg"><img alt="Stoma" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Opening_and_Closing_of_Stoma.svg/640px-Opening_and_Closing_of_Stoma.svg.png"/></a></p>
    
    </ol></li>

    <li>Define <em class="Defn">transpiration</em>.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Evaporation of water from the leaf.</p>

    <li>Explain how the <em class="Defn">guard cells</em> respond to wet or dry conditions to regulate gas exchange.</li>
    <p class="Answer">Turgor pressure (wet conditions) causes these cells to expand which opens the stomata. Plasmolysis (dry conditions) cause the cells to shrink which closes the stomata.</p>

    <li>Describe three important gases that need to be exchanged for the plant to remain healthy and explain how each gas is related to photosynthesis or cellular respiration.</li>
    <div class="Answer">
        <p>Oxygen: Produced by photosynthesis and consumed by cellular respiration.	</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide: Consumed by photosynthesis and produced by cellular respiration.	</p>
        <p>Water: Consumed by photosynthesis and produced by cellular respiration.</p>
    </div>

    <li>What is a <em class="Defn">lenticel</em> and what is its role in gas exchange?</li>
    <p class="Answer">A small hole in the trunk of a tree or woody plant that promotes gas exchange.</p>
