<section class="Slide"><h3>Photosynthesis</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Photosynthesis</em> is a chemical reaction that occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells (and in a few other organisms).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Photosynthnesis uses energy from sunlight to produce glucose:
        <p class="TeX">\rm{6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2}</p>
    </li>
    <li>For photosynthesis to occur, the chloroplast must have access to water, carbon dioxide, and light.</li>
    <li>Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called <em class="Defn">chlorophyll</em> that absorbs energy from sunlight and initiates the reaction.</li>
    <li>The chemical reaction is complicated and involves several steps.</li>
    <li>In the <em>light dependent</em> portion of the reaction, light energy is converted to ATP.</li>
    <li>In the <em>light independent</em> portion of the reaction, the ATP energy is used to produce glucose.</li>
    <li>All life relies on photosynthesis for energy.</li>
    <li>Organisms that can meet their own energy needs using photosynthesis are called <em class="Defn">autotrophic</em>.</li>
    <li>Organisms that cannot perform photosynthesis are called <em class="Defn">heterotrophic</em>. Heterotrophs must obtain energy by consuming other organisms.</li>
</ul>
</section>
    
<section class="Slide"><h3>Cellular Respiration</h3>
<p>When cells require energy, they break down glucose in a process called <em class="Defn">cellular respiration</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The chemical reaction for cellular respiration is the reverse of photosynthesis:
        <p class="TeX">\rm C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2 \rightarrow  6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O</p>
    </li>
    <li>The energy released by this reaction is used to create ATP, which the cell then uses for its energy requirements.</li>
    <li>As the reaction shows, cells require oxygen as well as glucose.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>In what kinds of organisms does photosynthesis occur?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Plants and some single-celled organisms</p>

    <li>What is the chemical equation for photosynthesis?</li>
    <div class="Answer Center">
        <p class="TeX">\rm{6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2}</p>
        <p>[carbon dioxide + water &rarr; glucose + oxygen]
        </p>
    </div>

    <li>Where in the cell (i.e. in which organelle) does photosynthesis occur?</li>
    <p class="Answer">Chloroplast</p>

    <li>Why is photosynthesis so important?</li>
    <p class="Answer">This allows the plant to store energy from sunlight which it needs to survive.</p>

    <li>What is cellular respiration? In which organelle does it occur?</li>
    <p class="Answer">This is the opposite of photosynthesis. The glucose is reacted to release the energy in the form of a chemical ATP. It occurs it the mitochondria.</p>

    <li>What is the chemical equation for cellular respiration?</li>
    <p class="Answer TeX">\rm{C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\ O_2 \rightarrow 6\ CO_2 + 6\ H_2O}</p>

    <li>How is cellular respiration similar to/different than combustion?</li>
    <p class="Answer">The reaction is very similar but it occurs much more slowly.</p>

    <li>What is ATP? What is its connection to photosynthesis and cellular respiration?</li>
    <p class="Answer">It is a chemical that the cell uses to store energy for immediate use.</p>
