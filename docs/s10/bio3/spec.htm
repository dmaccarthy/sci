<p>If we <em>doubled</em> the size of a cell...</p>
<ul>
    <li>The volume would increase by a factor of <em>eight</em>.</li>
    <li>The cell would require 8 times as much energy and raw materials and would need to get rid of 8 times as much waste.</li>
    <li>The cell membrane would only be <em>four</em> times larger.</li>
    <li>The cell membrane would need to work twice as hard!</li>
    <li>The larger the cell becomes, the more difficult it becomes for the membrane to provide enough raw materials and eliminate waste.</li>
    <li>If a cell was the size of a person, it would take a long time for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse to or from the centre of the cell.</li>
    <li>This places a practical limit on how large a single cell can be!</li>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Multicellular Organisms</h3>
<p>Life has evaded the cell-size limit by forming <em class="Defn">multicellular</em> organisms; organisms that consist of many cells.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A human body contains on the order of 10<sup>13</sup> cells.</li>
    <li>Advantages of multicellular organisms include:<ul>
        <li>Larger size</li>
        <li>Cell specialization</li>
        <li>Ability to survive a variety of environments</li>
    </ul></li>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Specialization</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Cell specialization</em> means that in a multicellular organism, different cells perform different functions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Specialized cells in humans and other animals include: nerve cells, muscle cells, fat cells, red and white blood cells, and more.</li>
    <div>
        <li>The illustration below shows some of the specialized cells and structures in a leaf...</li>
        <p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><a target="Wiki" title="Click for source info" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leaf_Structure.svg"><img class="w32" data-aspect="1.5" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Leaf_Structure.svg"/></a></p>
    </div>
    <li>The upper and lower <em class="Defn">epidermal cells</em> form a protective layer, one cell thick, on the upper and lower surface of the leaf.</li>
    <li>Epidemal cells produce a waxy <em class="Defn">cuticle</em> (not made of living cells!) that coats the leaf to prevent excess water loss.</li>
    <li>Below the upper epidermis are tightly packed <em class="Defn">palisade tissue cells</em>. These are the primary site of photosynthesis, where the greatest amount of sunlight is available.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">spongy mesophyll</em> is located below the palisade cells. These cells are looslely packed to allow the gases involved in photosynthesis (water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen) to easily circulate.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Stomata</em> are small openings in the lower epidermis that allows CO<sub>2</sub> in for photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> out.</li>
    <li>The stomata are formed by a pair of <em class="Defn">guard cells</em>.</li>
    <li>Note: There is an error in the labelling of the leaf picture in your textbook. The stomata are the openings <em>between</em> the guard cells. The stomata lines on the picture actually point to guard cells.</li>
    <li>In dry conditions, the guard cells shrivel (plasmolysis) to close the opening and reduce water loss.</li>
    <li>In wetter conditions, the guard cells expand; the increased turgor pressure changes the shape of the cells to create the opening, allowing more water vapour to leave the leaf.</li>
    <li>The leaf also contains two types of <em class="Defn">vascular tissue</em> often found together in a <em class="Defn">vascular bundle</em>...</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">xylem</em> are the cell walls of dead cells, that form tubes allowing water and minerals (xylem sap) to flow into the leaf from the roots.</li>
    <li>The <em class="Defn">phloem</em> are living cells that carry the sugary sap produced by photosynthesis in the leaf to other parts of the plant.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Levels of Organizations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Tissues</em> are groups of similar cells.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Organs</em> are tissues of different types that work together to perform some useful function for the organism.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Systems</em> are groups of organs/tissues that together meet some essential need of the organism.</li>
