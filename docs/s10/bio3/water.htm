</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Absorption of Water</h3>
<p>A plant’s system for transporting water and nutrients is called the <em>vascular system</em>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Water enters the plant through <em>osmosis</em>, from the soil into cells in the <em>root</em>.</li>
    <li>Minerals will enter via passive or active transport.</li>
    <li><em class="Defn">Root hairs</em> are outgrowths from root epidermal cells that increase the surface area of the cell, making absorption more effective.

</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Xylem</h3>
<p>Water and minerals move from the root cells into the xylem.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em class="Defn">Xylem</em> are dead tracheid cells that form hollow tubes.
    <p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><img alt="Xylem" data-aspect="640/361" class="w22" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Herbaceoaus_Dicot_Stem_Xylem_Vessels_in_Older_Richinus_%2835474133884%29.jpg/640px-Herbaceoaus_Dicot_Stem_Xylem_Vessels_in_Older_Richinus_%2835474133884%29.jpg"/></p>

    </li>
    <li>The water and minerals mixture is called <em class="Defn">xylem sap</em>.</li>
    <li>As water is needed for photosynthesis, the water must reach the leaves where most photosynthesis takes place.</li>
    <li>For large plants (e.g. maple trees), transporting water large distances <em>against gravity</em> is an issue.</li>
    <li>Forces that assist the upward motion of water are:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Root pressure: The turgor pressure of the expanded root cells pushing the water up the xylem. This is adequate for small plants but not for large trees.</li>
        <li>Cohesion: The tendency of molecules of the same type to stick to each other. This is strong in water due to its <em>hydrogen bonds</em>.</li>
        <li>Adhesion: The tendency of moleules to stick to other molecules, like water to the cellulose of the xylem tubes.</li>
        <li>Transpiration: (See below)</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Transpiration</h3>
<p><em class="Defn">Transpiration</em> is the evaporation of water in the leaf, resulting in diffusion of water vapour out through the stomata.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most of the water taken in through the roots (> 97%) is “lost” through transpiration.</li>
    <li>Less than 3% of the water intake is acutally used for photosynthesis.</li>
    <li>Because of the strong cohesion between water molecules, the evaporating water molecules exert a force on the chain of water molecules behind them, creating a force that helps pull the water up the plant.

</ul>
</section>

<section class="Slide"><h3>Phloem</h3>
<p>Once photosynthesis has occured in the leaf, the sugar produced must be trasported to the rest of the plant.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sugar transport occurs in living cells called <em class="Defn">phloem</em>.</li>
    <li>The sugar mixture being transported is called <em class="Defn">phloem sap</em>, or just sap.</li>
    <li>The sugary sap is used to make maple syrup, for example.</li>
    <li>Phloem tissue contains <em class="Defn">seive tubes</em> through which the sap moves.
    <p data-cue="prev" class="Center"><a target="Wiki" title="Click for source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phloem_cells.svg"><img alt="Phloem Diagram" data-aspect="40/48" class="w22" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Phloem_cells.svg"/></a></p></li>
    <li>Sugar is moved into the seive tube elements (cells) by active transport in the leaf.</li>
    <li>Water follows by osmosis, increasing the pressure which allows the sap to be pushed into the adjacent cells through <em class="Defn">seive plates</em>.</li>
    <li>Seive tube elements contain few organelles, and their metabolic functions are performed by nearby <em class="Defn">companion cells</em>.</li>
    <li>Xylem and phloem are often found together in <em>vascular bundles</em>.
